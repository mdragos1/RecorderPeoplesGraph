Despite its picturesque setting\n80 km north of the Pyrenees and 80 km east of the Atlantic,\nOrthez is off the beaten tourist track. Locals quoted by a French regional paper\nwere sceptical about the Romanians' plans, saying that renovating the ruin\nwould be ruinously expensive. Amid the general disbelief,\nscathing comments were posted: \"I smell a con…\" \"France is a Third World country,\nRomania's buying it now.\" The French publication was unclear\nas to who the investors were, variously referring to them as\n\"a Romanian\" and \"Romanians\". The mayor of Orthez, who was quoted too,\nmuddied the waters further by saying he'd met \"Romanians\"\nand liked their considerateness. The only Romanian named\nwas Benjamin Gont. The newspaper later stated\nthat he hailed from Sinaia. There is only one Benjamin Gont,\nor rather Beniamin Gonț, in Sinaia. After the revolution, the 31-year-old\nand his parents and many siblings lived in a working-class area,\ncrammed into a two-room flat. - Gonț?\n- Gonț. He lived here\non the ground floor. He's the one with lots of kids.\nHe lived there, where it's closed. - They were... hard up.\n- They were hard up. The family's humble origins\nmake its ex-neighbours doubtful that any member of it\ncould invest serious money in France now. They'll build a hotel, a restaurant.\nBig bucks. - It won't be them.\n- No. - I don't think so.\n- No chance! Bigger fish might be behind them. I reckon other people\nare pulling their strings. Back in today's social media age, Beniamin Gonț can be seen\nin photos on Facebook. Of particular note are some taken\nin the run-up to the 2016 local elections. They show Gonț campaigning\nfor the mayor of Sinaia, who was running for\na fourth straight term. When he took to the streets\ntoting posters of Mayor Oprea, Gonț was 23\nand was studying medicine in Târgu Mureș. He got into his school\nby claiming to be Roma. He was three points\noff the admission cut-off mark but was given one of the places reserved\nfor this disadvantaged ethnic group. He failed two years\nand was also expelled twice. He dropped out in 2016,\nthe year when he campaigned for Mayor Oprea. Give it up for Vlad Oprea! A YouTube video from 2017 shows him\npounding the pavements for Oprea again in a march against an anti-corruption prosecutor\nwho was investigating the mayor. In the footage,\nhe can be seen leading the cheerleading and preventing any let-up\nin the chanting. Oprea! Oprea!\nOprea! Oprea! Oprea! Oprea! Nowadays,\nlocals in Sinaia say Beniamin Gonț follows Mayor Vlad Oprea around\nlike his shadow. They saunter to the sauna together, hang out together\nat Oprea's petrol station in Sinaia, promenade in the park as a pair and dine out as a duo. Here, they're checking the electrics\nof an eatery the mayor's family owns. They jetted off to\nan international tourism conference together even though Gonț\nhas no official Sinaia Council role. Being the mayor's sidekick\nis not without its perks. Favours are bestowed on you\nby a perennial election-winner who's amassed a property empire\nwith his family. In 20 years as supremo\nof Romania's richest ski resort, Oprea has racked up a long list\nof political connections. I very much appreciate the real support\nyou've given, Mayor, to not only Sinaians,\nbut also our youth movement. Let's hear it for him! Lucky for Sinaia it elected Vlad Oprea\nwhen he was 36! Proof of Oprea's largesse towards Gonț\nis easy to find. Property deals between the pair\nmake the point clear. For instance, Gonț acquired a studio\nin this block from Oprea's firm for €25,000. Soon afterwards, he sold it\nfor its true value, €60,000. In this pretty part of town,\nGonț got a plot for €40/m2, a steal compared with\nthe going rate: €110/m2. The whopping discount\nwas given by Oprea's sister. These facts,\nwhich we uncovered without much effort, and tip-offs\nand images from locals prompted us to probe\nthe Oprea-Gonț double act in France. We went to Orthez,\nwhere the Romanians had made waves, to find out if Gonț and Oprea\nwere joined at the hip there too and if Vlad Oprea,\nSinaia's mayor for two decades, had had a hand in the chateau purchase\nalong with Beniamin Gonț. We talked to people\nliving near the chateau. Most only knew what they'd read in the papers\nabout the Romanian newcomers or seen when peeking over the fence\nat a red vehicle with Romanian plates. No, they're workmen. The papers say they're workers. I've seen a red van going past regularly\nfor a month. - A Ford?\n- I don't know, a red van. Yes, maybe. But this elderly farmer living\nright by the chateau had the inside track. He waxed positively lyrical about\nhis cordial relations with our compatriots. This is how I got to know them.\nFive Romanians came. I was cutting the grass\nwith my tractor back there. Two people came. One came over and said:\n\"Hello, Sir, hello!\" - I said: \"You're not from round here\", as I do...\n- To people with strange accents. \"You're not from here.\"\n\"No, from Romania.\" \"Ah, Romania!\" I said, and I laughed\nas Romanians don't have a great... - Reputation here.\n- Yes. To avoid getting too sidetracked\nin this rambling chinwag, we refocused on\nwhat we were in France to find out: had the Sinaia mayor been\nto the chateau officially bought by Gonț? We showed the farmer a photo of Oprea\nto see if he knew him. The Frenchman's face lit up. He recounted his many encounters\nwith the mayor with relish. Was this guy one of them? - Yes, he speaks great French. He's Jean.\n- His name's Jean? - Yes.\n- You're sure? Yes! That's him? - Yes! He's very kind!\n- Very kind? Yes! He speaks French. The mayor of Sinaia has two forenames:\nVlad and Gheorghe, but for reasons unknown, he becomes \"Jean\"\nwhen visiting the chateau. I'm very glad because he's smiley.\nHe's got a bit of a belly, like me. Jean was here several times? I've seen him with Benjamin Gont… Not often, seven or eight times\nsince they bought the chateau. That's a lot! He's not there all the time, or now.\nI've not seen him in a while. I saw him when I took some iron to Mont,\nI had some to sell. I was on my way back in a tractor\nwith a worker who was doing me a favour. I saw a car... He waved at me and I said:\n\"Gosh! It's the Romanian.\" He stopped.\nSo did I. First, he gave me a three-litre bottle.\n\"Mr Mosques!\" \"Thanks, how kind!\" I asked Jean:\n\"When are you coming?\" I'd been expecting him for ages.\nThey hadn't come in the winter. Or the spring. He was in the car with Benjamin.\nI said: \"When are you coming?\" He said: \"We're a bit behind schedule.\"\nA bit?! This was in May. \"We'll be there in a fortnight.\" Okay. I said:\n\"With the Romanians?\" He said:\n\"We've got great companies in Romania.\" Mhm, okay. If the farmer is to be believed, Gonț and Oprea are as inseparable here\nas they are in Romania. Despite having nothing to do with the chateau\nin theory, Oprea visits Orthez often and lavishes attention on the neighbours\nto get in with them. And when asked about the chateau,\nOprea gives details of the work schedule, explains the stoppages\nand says when the work will resume. His insider knowledge of the refurb\nsuggests he's an owner, not a sightseer. The forthcoming farmer's account\nof the Romanians he'd met reminded us that the mayor of Orthez\nhad told the local rag he'd met \"Romanians\"\nand liked \"their\" considerateness. The mayor had refused to give details\nof his Romanian rendezvous, but we dropped in on him anyway in the hope he'd let slip\nany specifics he knew about Oprea and Oprea's unofficial ownership\nof the chateau put in Gonț's name. - Hello!\n- Hello! - Hello!\n- Have a seat. Monsieur le maire\nwelcomed us warmly but was visibly irked by our key question\nabout Vlad Oprea's role in the investment. La République des Pyrénées\nquoted you as saying you'd had a polite and constructive chat\nwith the Romanians. Can you elaborate? As I said before, what I discuss with investors\nstays between them and me. There's no confidentiality clause as such,\nbut investors bear the risks so it's not for me\nto reveal what's said. Was Mr Oprea one of the people\nwho came to see you? Why ask that? Isn't there... What's your angle?\nIsn't it just Romanians investing in France? No, Mr Oprea's also a public figure. Oh. So? - He's an important mayor in Romania.\n- I know he is. So? That's neither here nor there, whether an investor's a public figure,\nI won't comment on that. I wouldn't like it\nif someone did that to me, because if I invest in a private capacity,\nnot as mayor of Orthez, I'm not committing Orthez. Despite his discomfiture,\nthe Orthez official gave us the info we wanted: that a Romanian mayor\nwas involved in the investment. As for the French mayor's view that a public figure's business dealings\nare a private matter, it doesn't hold true in Romania. Romanians are entitled to know about\npoliticians' assets and businesses. And the Orthez chateau makeover\nwill entail a massive outlay. The ramshackle building was bought\nfor just €120,000, but the revamp\nwill cost far more. It's a ruin now, but give it two or three years\nand some money, and it'll be beautiful. - Any idea what that'll cost?\n- A fortune. - Meaning?\n- I can't repeat it. I've heard, but it's so much… - €2 million?\n- Yes. More. - More than €2 million?\n- Yes. Only one other local knew the exact identities\nof the Romanians behind the restoration: Eric Bonnaventure, the architect who did\nthe plans for the hotel-restaurant conversion. So we visited him too,\nagain to find out how involved Oprea was in the restoration\nof the chateau ostensibly bought by Gonț. We were upfront\nabout being Romanian journalists and asked to see the blueprints\nfor the project. We'd like to ask some questions,\nif you agree, about a design you did\nfor a Romanian public figure, a mayor, here in Orthez. - I don't know if I can answer.\n- Excuse me? I don't know if I can talk about that. - Due to confidentiality clauses?\n- Yes. - We'd like to see the plans…\n- It's private. Private... We can't see how it'll look\nwhen it's finished? Not even an estimate\nof the investment cost? - No, that's private.\n- It's private. It's between him and me.\nIf he agrees, we can talk, but if not... - Do you get on well with this politician?\n- Yes, it's gone very well. Very well.\nHave you been to Sinaia? - No.\n- No. We met here. Has the mayor\ninvited you to Sinaia? Yes, but I didn't have\nthe time to go. Are you confident about this project,\nthis development? Yes, yes, because there's no hotel\nof that standard here. Will it be a five-star hotel? - I don't know.\n- You don't… Four or five? The hotel I designed\ncould be a five-star, but that'll be decided later,\ndepending on the details. - Have you met Mr Gonț too?\n- Yes. - They both come?\n- Yes. - They see you together.\n- Yes. - Is it the mayor who takes the decisions?\n- I can't say. - I don't know.\n- Okay. I talk,\nthen we take decisions jointly. Although the architect was cagey\nabout the plans and the project's price tag, he too confirmed to us that Oprea was all over the renovation\nwith Beniamin Gonț constantly in tow. Our tour of Orthez ended\nat the chateau bought by the Romanians. We met workers brought in\nfrom Romania. Hello! They weren't thrilled\nthat we spoke their language. Who and what do you want?\nTurn the camera off if you want to keep it. - Hi. Ovidiu Vanghele.\n- Hi. What's this about? - We're from Recorder.\n- Yes. We want to know about\nMayor Oprea's property here. - Who says it's his?\n- The town hall. - Which one?\n- Here, Orthez. Is there a sign\nsaying it's his? - No, we saw another name, Gonț.\n- Yes. - You're Mr Gonț's brother?\n- Yes. Tell us what'll happen… - On what basis? Arsing about here too, eh?\n- Huh? - You've got a lot of spare time.\n- It's our job. Your job's to bug people? - This is winding me up.\n- Sorry. The owner's Gonț,\nnot Oprea. This cobblers\nis doing my head in even more. This is Daniel Gonț, Beniamin's brother\nand a friend of Oprea, as he himself says. Daniel even starred\nin one of Mayor Oprea's election videos. I'm happy with how our town looks\nand of course I can only vote for Vlad Oprea. He admitted the Sinaia mayor\nhad been to the chateau, but our curiosity about Oprea\ntouched a nerve. What's going on?\nI don't get it. It's interesting to see\nwho's behind this. We went to the town hall.\nWe met the architect, the neighbours. They say they met Vlad Oprea, he was here.\nIt's very simple. Say you do something you're proud of\nand you give it your all. Don't you invite your friends\nto see it? I've got nothing to hide. \"Look, I came and ploughed\nfive years' profit into this.\" \"Maybe it'll work out,\nmaybe not.\" So I think he did come with me\nonce or twice, but spare me that story,\nthat thing blew up before I left home. - A hotel...\n- I wanna understand this Vlad Oprea thing. I'm sick of being labelled.\nNot that it's a bad label, he's quality. Your brother's friends\nwith the mayor. - So am I, lots of us are.\n- Okay. He's got friends,\nprobably as he's decent. - No comment.\n- But it's not his house. This is of public interest\nbecause there are suspicions that this is another of Vlad Oprea's\nunknown assets. No way. Okay. It belongs to... - The sign says.\n- Beniamin Gonț. - My brother. It's staying because it's his.\n- Fine. Got it. Wanna know how he makes money?\n\"I run a knocking shop, a coca farm. Do you snort?\" - \"Fancy a joint?\" Really.\n- No. The media's sent you.\nOkay, it's your job. At 8 pm. You're here for a reason. - Who's funding this charade?\n- I'll tell you. Someone's paying them,\nthey won't tell me who sent 'em. Travelling 3,000 km to get here\ncosts money. The French have praised us Romanians.\nShame on you for doing us down. Hold on. They've written a nice item\nabout our lovely project. If you want to know where the money's from\nor who's behind this, you'll find him\nand me here again. If you want to know\nif it's dirty money, check. That's our job. We're not billionaire\nmoney launderers like Năstase. What will the work cost? - It's an estimate.\n- We were told €2 million. - I dunno, maybe more.\n- Maybe more. If you want to dig deeper, follow the money\nand see what we do in Sinaia. - Go find out.\n- We will. - I'm no thief.\n- All the best, Sir. - I won't go to jail.\n- God bless! We took up Daniel Gonț's invitation\nand went to Sinaia in Romania to trace the Gonț brothers' money\nand see if their businesses had done well enough to fund a €2-3 million\nrenovation of a western European chateau. They hadn't. By the time Daniel Gonț challenged us\nto count the cash, they'd barely turned over €850,000. The Gonț family's most visible business\nis in Sinaia's central park: a refreshments caravan\nand amusements for children. It's like a mini-funfair\nin the town's tourist and cultural hotspot. The Gonț brothers' street business\nexploits its prime location with high footfall by ripping people off. - How do the prices seem?\n- High. 15 lei is a lot for 5 minutes. - Where are you from? Can you compare?\n- Italy. - What do you pay in Italy?\n- €5 for half an hour or at least 20 minutes. A bit steep,\n5 minutes for 15 lei. - Our kid didn't have time...\n- To take her shoes off! They said the time was up,\nwe paid for another 5 minutes. It's a bit much. The only obvious reason\nfor the business's success is its smack-bang-central location,\nwhich it got from Sinaia Council. The Gonț brothers also own a caravan\nby the Valea Soarelui chairlift at an elevation of 2,000 m. It too is a gold mine\nin an enviable business location in the Sinaia local authority area. So the Gonțs' money\nseems to come from ideal business spots\nthat were in Oprea's gift to give. A mayor's number one task\nis to raise living standards. It's very important that all Sinaians feel\ntheir lives are improving day by day. Oprea certainly makes life rosier\nfor his pals, and his kindness to his own family's firms\nknows no bounds. Privacons SRL is a construction firm\nowned on paper by his octogenarian mother. For years, Privacons has run\na concrete plant beside the River Prahova on land owned by Romanian Railways\nwhich it had no right to use. Privacons also runs Oblique,\na guesthouse in Sinaia which offers 20 rooms even though\nits rating certificate only mentions 15. The site it occupies was obtained\nfrom the council after Oprea became mayor. The work took nearly seven years and I really wanted to set an example\nto other tourist establishments and show that you can build\na very small building on a big plot. Through another firm, Oprea's family runs\na petrol station on the Sinaia bypass that lacks\na proper fire safety certificate. Last year, after warnings,\nthe Prahova Emergencies Inspectorate fined it RON 50,000 as a result. Through Oprea's ex-brother-in-law,\nthe family owns this chalet restaurant beside the valley station\nof the 1,400-2,000 m gondola lift. It's another nifty money-spinner\nin a lucrative location. Although the chalet was extended\nwithout planning permission, Mayor Oprea sold the land under it\nto his brother-in-law for just €70/m2. Yet all these nice little earners don't seem\nto satisfy Oprea's business appetite. An ex-friend of the mayor\nsays Oprea routinely recruits proxies to front new ventures in the town. My wife and I were cronies of his.\nWe tried to set up a business or two. We wanted to set up stalls\noutside the Prestarea store and sell local traditional items,\nat that point. The council as good as gave them away,\nthey rigged the process. They put up the cash and the company\nwas in our name, we ran the whole show. We got to keep\n30% of the takings. 70% went to them:\n35% to Vlad Oprea and 35% to Beni Gonț. Emil Nenciu was in Oprea's circle\nfor a long time. The mayor's sister was his marital godmother,\nand through her, he became a buddy of Oprea's. But years later,\nthe friends fell out. Nenciu told us candidly about\nthe eyebrow-raising errands he ran for Oprea as a courier of gifts and cash-filled envelopes\nsent to the mayor by businessmen. Money was left in envelopes\nat the petrol station on Sundays. I took them to the mayor's home. He came out to pick them up,\nor his mother came out. There was a lift,\na staircase and a ledge. He'd tell me to leave the envelope\nin the staircase. - Oprea did?\n- Yes, Oprea himself. I also picked up gifts,\ncases of wine from the petrol station. - The envelopes definitely had money in?\n- Yup. You could see it, some were open. Nenciu says the mayor also got him\nto attend Sinaia Council auctions. He said they needed someone\nto make up the numbers at an auction. He asked me to go along\nso he could get some plots of land. Naturally, I agreed. Transparency requires several bidders. As long as there's more than one,\nit's credible. I was coached\nto keep the price down. - Who by?\n- The mayor. I asked him what to do,\nI didn't have a clue. He said to pull out. Beniamin Gonț,\nOprea's constant companion, attended an auction sale of a plot\nin the town's poshest neighbourhood. The winning bidder was Privacons SRL,\nthe mayor's mother's construction firm. But the auctions Nenciu mentioned\npale into insignificance beside a 2.2-hectare mega-concession\nin Bucegi Nature Park. No public notice was posted online\nand only one bidder turned up: a firm in Cosmin Fleancu's Novum Group\nthat wanted to build a hotel and a water park. Before winning\nas the sole bidder, Novum's owner paid €250,000\nto the mayor's mother's firm, Privacons SRL. For this over-the-odds price\nworking out at €250/m2, he got some land low on tourist appeal\nby the Bucharest-Brașov railway line. Privacons had bought it a year earlier\nfrom a Sinaia Council employee for a quarter of that sum. The fact that the Novum boss had paid\n€0.25 million to the mayor's mother's firm shortly before landing the 2.2-hectare\nBucegi Nature Park concession invited a natural question\nwhich we put to him. Could his payment\nfor the overpriced railwayside land have been a camouflaged backhander\nfor Oprea given so he could clinch the concession\nin a one-horse race? How did you find out about\nthe council's water park concession? Yes, I saw it on their website.\nIt was in our line, we're in hotels… - They published it on their website?\n- Yes, I saw it on the website. A few months before the bidding process,\nyou bought a plot from the mayor's family. How did you come to buy land from the mayor\njust a few months before that process? - Don't know, I'd have to check.\n- Check what? If that's true. It's by the railway line,\nZamora 2 is the postal address. Probably for aparthotels,\nwhere we have that 9,000-metre plot. But you're not sure?\nIt's pretty undesirable land. No, but I'll check. It's highly suspicious that you paid\nthe mayor's family €250,000 for that land and then won a big concession,\na big project. One wonders whether this €250,000 purchase\nwas a disguised bribe you gave the mayor so he'd help you\nwin the process. God forbid! Why say that?\nThat's common in Romania. God forbid! Novum isn't the only big investor in Sinaia\nthat paid Privacons before starting work. Some years ago, the Nordis Group\nowned by the husband of PSD MP Laura Vicol announced a luxury property development. In 2021, months after Sinaia Council\ngave it one of the permits it needed, Nordis paid €200,000\nto the mayor's mother's firm. Not even the foundation stage\nwas reached, but Oprea’s family profited\nfrom the little work it did. The mayor's mother's firm\nwas also paid by the owners\nof the \"Chatel\" residential complex. After Mayor Oprea issued\na construction permit, some of the work here\nwas done by Privacons. Oprea's mother's firm billed about €900,000\nbetween 2019 and 2022 for services provided\nto the Turkish developer. So, yet again, Oprea licensed,\nOprea built and Oprea got paid. Oprea also sang. ♪ My gang can't sit still for a minute,\nMy gang… ♪ Videos obtained by Recorder\nshow the mayor partying in pubs with the Turkish firm's representative\nwhile his family was on its payroll. ♪ C'mon and join if you feel… ♪ In this clip, Vlad Oprea belts out hits\nin a boozer in Sinaia. The appreciative audience includes\nGokhan Bugatir, the developer's representative. Oprea's backing singer\nis his brother-in-law at the time, who still heads\nSinaia Council's Planning Committee. In other videos\nRecorder obtained, the ex-brother-in-law\ngets even closer to the Turkish investor. This isn't Romania... Here we see them tucking into fillet of beef\nin a restaurant in Turkey. Wow! - How was it?\n- A bomb. Top-notch. Another bomb was the zonal plan\nthe mayor and his brother-in-law gave their Turkish chum\nvia the council. The plan allowed one storey more\nthan the regulations did and flouted the requirement\nto widen two public roads. The Prahova Prefect's Office took legal action\nand the plan was ruled illegal. The Turkish investors' representative,\nGokhan Bugatir, declined to comment on his close personal\nand financial ties with the Oprea family but did say he'd complain\nto the Turkish embassy about our rudeness. All these thriving businesses\nare run well out of public sight, but big money has a way\nof making itself noticed. Two years ago,\nafter pocketing all those huge sums, Privacons started building\na 1,000 m2 family mansion in a conservation area\nin Sinaia's historic heart, close to a trio\nof familiar landmarks: Sinaia Monastery,\nthe Hotel Palace and the casino. The conspicuous building site\ndisplayed not just the Opreas' wealth, but also the mayor's blasé placing\nof his own interests above his public duty. The not-so-humble abode\nstands as an impressive testament to what a mayor can do\nafter 20 years in office. Oprea had the premium plot restituted to a descendant of\nex-foreign minister Nicolae Titulescu who historians say had no claim\nto the famed interwar diplomat's estate. The land later passed,\nin an under-the-table cash sale, to an underling of Oprea\nand then to Privacons. Even if we overlook\nhow Oprea came by the land, we can't ignore the street he built\nfor the house with public money. It extends 70 metres\nfrom beside Sinaia Monastery into the depths of the forest,\nwhere there were only trees before. A dryly humorous touch\nis the \"Residents only\" sign at the end. The only resident is the mayor. And there's no room for any others\non this narrow road sandwiched between a steep drop\nand the monastery park. Oprea didn't stop at building a road\nfor his 1,000 m2 home. He also wanted a stepped alleyway\nas a shortcut to the town centre. But the icing on this layer cake\nof conflicts of interest came when spade was put to soil. Privacons, Oprea's mother's firm,\nwas assisted by workers and machinery from –\nsurprise, surprise – Sinaia Council. Excuse me, can we talk to someone\nin charge here? - Can we?\n- Dunno. You work here, right? Can we talk to someone? Now you see them... One phone call\nand it's bye-bye. Clad in Sinaia Council vests,\nthe workers gave us the slip by retreating indoors. Excuse me... We have a question.\nHello? This man tending to\na nearby county council water tank had seen the hive of activity\noutside the Oprea residence. Have they stopped?\nThey were working. Fantastic! If you stay till tonight,\nyou'll really hold them up! What was here before? - A wood.\n- A wood? A wood.\nThere was a path. Our van couldn't get\nto the tank here. They did all this\nsince June last year. Goodness me! Does the mayor come here often? Of course.\nHe was supposed to come now. He's due here now? - But they must have phoned to warn him.\n- Phoned him? This video footage\nshould dispel any doubts about whether the mansion\nbuilt by Privacons is the mayor's. It shows Vlad Oprea visiting the site\nthroughout the construction process. Here, he's giving the house the once-over\nduring a Sunday service at the monastery. Here, he's instructing workmen. On a Saturday when the heavens open,\nhe comes probably to keep materials dry. On a weekday, when he should be at work,\nhe rocks up in a Sinaia Council vehicle. Oprea is met by Beniamin Gonț,\nhis ever-present cohort in Sinaia and the mysterious owner on paper\nof the French chateau. Although Gonț has no official role\nin the works, he looks for all the world\nlike Mayor Vlad Oprea's right-hand man. Mr Beniamin Gonț,\nare you working on the mayor's house? Are you working on the mayor's house? As if Beniamin's presence\nwasn't enough, his brother Daniel, the feisty foreman\nwe'd met at the Orthez chateau, also put in an appearance. Although he'd invited us to ferret out\nhis family's finances in Romania, he was too tied up to talk again\nnow that we'd done that. Mr Daniel Gonț? Hello! Mr Daniel Gonț? Our investigation\nhad come full circle from a chateau in Orthez\nto something similar in Sinaia, both visited\nby the same cast of characters: Vlad Oprea, Sinaia's veteran mayor,\nand satellites who never left his orbit. We gave Oprea every opportunity\nto answer the questions our research raised. We wrote to request\ndocuments and details as to how he'd come to own\nthe land by the monastery and build his own private road. But he blithely broke the law\nby not obliging. Then we phoned\nto request an interview. He didn't answer,\nso we asked through Sinaia's city manager. Could you fix up a chat with the mayor?\nYou're the city manager. Can someone explain to me\nhow a house is built in a forest? This retaining wall…\nWhat's going on in Sinaia? If he's the mayor, of course he did it!\nHe gives permits… A woman's just gone past.\nWe're here on the steps… - I believe you.\n- Did you hear? - I can ask him if he wants…\n- Okay. - I'll ask.\n- Thanks a lot! - My pleasure!\n- Bye! A FEW MINUTES LATER Yes, go ahead. I passed on your message. - Mr Vlad Oprea agrees to talk to you...\n- Okay. ...provided he's not recorded\nin any way. Nothing's off the record! - The mayor and I aren't friends.\n- That's irrelevant. I want to talk to the mayor\nfor work purposes, I'm a journalist, and I'm doing a piece\nabout the mayor. I don't want to talk to him\noff the record. We ended up lying in wait for him\nat a National Liberal Party meeting on his home turf,\nat the Hotel Mara in Sinaia. We want to ask if you have properties\nin France registered to Mr Beniamin Gonț. Do you have any\nin Mr Beniamin Gonț's name? - You've been to France many times.\n- Mind your own! The neighbours know you.\nYou met the architect, Bonnaventure, a few times… - You're sick!\n- Why are we sick? Won't you answer?\nDo you have French properties in Mr Gonț's name? What relationship\ndo you and Mr Gonț have? After the meeting began,\nwe met Dan Radu in the foyer. He runs council-owned firm Sinaia Forever\nand is Beniamin Gonț's brother-in-law. - Hello, manager! How are you?\n- Fine. You? Normally, he'd have no reason\nto be kicking his heels at a party event. Do you have other duties\nbesides running Sinaia Forever? - Why did...\n- Nice coffee! - ...you come with Mr Oprea?\n- I came alone. Just after Mr Oprea. Has Mr Oprea given you unofficial duties\nto go with him to events? You're the boss of Sinaia Forever\nwith however many subordinates, it's nearly 11 o'clock, and you're near the mayor\nat a party event. Whatever. A few hours later,\nduring a break, we found out\nwhat Oprea's henchman's duties were. Why are you running away from us,\nMayor? Why are you getting\nyour employee to block us? Is he your bodyguard or a company boss?\nHave you stopped the work? - What are you doing here?\n- Nothing. What's the cost of your mansion\nby the monastery? God, they're so sick! Our questions went unanswered again. Guarded by the company boss, Oprea vanished among the PNL ministers\nand MPs at the Sinaia meeting. By blending into the scrum\nof political heavyweights, Oprea unwittingly gave a symbolic answer\nto the questions raised by his casual mixing of mayorship\nwith self-interest. The company he keeps elevates him\nto a status far higher than that of mayor. The posse of multi-millionaires\nand grandees he cosies up to filed past us\non his last birthday, which he celebrated in another castle,\nstate-owned this time: Foișor Castle, built by Carol I,\nextended by Ceaușescu and now run by RA-APPS,\na body under the PNL's political control. The law governing RA-APPS\nsays Foișor Palace can only be used by major state institutions,\nnot for private parties. RA-APPS didn't answer\nour written question about why Oprea was allowed\nto have his big day in the castle. - What are you here for?\n- A private event. - A private event?\n- Yes. - Off to Mr Oprea's party?\n- I don't know who you are! Hello!\nWhere are you going? These images of guests being ushered\nby state guards on sentry duty and getting the red-carpet treatment at an\ninvitation-only soirée at a ceremonial palace add a finishing touch\nto the picture of Vlad Oprea as a luxury-loving social climber. - Where are you going?\n- The mayor's birthday! - It's here at Foișor?\n- I think... - Were the restaurants all booked up?\n- It's his choice. What can I do? Has he had it here before? - I don't know.\n- You don't. The VIPs ferried by\nthe procession of flash cars included politicians, businessmen contracted\nby Sinaia Council and hoteliers. Our sources said the most notable name\non the Foișor guest list was Lucian Bode, the PNL's general secretary\nand an ex-Home Secretary. That Oprea and Bode are in cahoots\nis no secret within the Sinaia mayor's circle. Emil Nenciu saw it for himself. Mayor Vlad Oprea brags about being friends –\nhis words, not mine – with Mr Lucian Bode. I know, I've been to dos with Lucian Bode,\nthe mayor, Raluca Turcan and Valeriu Turcan… But the Oprea-Bode alliance\nisn't just attested to by eyewitnesses. It was sealed when the mayor's associates\nhelped to build a holiday home in Sinaia for the PNL general secretary. Many years ago,\nOprea's family paid a knockdown price for some land which was deforested\nunder false pretences. Later, it was sold to Lucian Bode,\nagain at an undervalue. In spring 2023,\nwhen Bode was still Home Secretary, a dormant firm with no staff\nor construction experience started building twin villas on it. The firm's owner was Beniamin Gonț,\nOprea's wingman, and the villas\nstanding just metres apart belonged to the mayor\nand Lucian Bode through his son, Ștefan. If we work on the assumption –\nbacked up by our research – that Gonț is a stand-in for Oprea,\nthen the Sinaia mayor is building Bode's pad after his sister let Bode\nhave the land cheaply. We wondered how the PNL general secretary\nhad come to buy land from Oprea's sister and hire Oprea's alter ego\nas builder. In June 2022, two years ago,\nyou bought some land from the mayor's sister. How did that deal come about? Yes, it's a 500 m2 plot... Size is relative… Some of the people taking care of me here\nhave garages bigger than that plot. I really like Sinaia. I decided with my family\nto make this investment. I'm friends\nwith Mayor Oprea in Sinaia, just as I am\nwith hundreds of Liberal mayors. I don't know who owned it before I bought the land. I went to the notary,\nI bought the 500 m2 plot, and I'm trying\nto get a little cabin built there... Did you ask the mayor\nif he had land for sale? No, I asked if I could find\n500 m2 of land in Sinaia. - And he offered…\n- No, he said... I talked to\nthe only notary in Sinaia. So the notary, not Vlad Oprea,\nput you onto Mr Oprea's sister. - I don't know Mr Oprea's sister.\n- Anca David. I didn't see Mr Oprea's sister.\nI saw someone with the title deeds. I bought the 500 m2 plot\nand declared the asset, thank you! Mr Bode,\nthat doesn't wash. You paid €60/m2,\na discount on the local price, €100/m2... Mr Stănescu, I bought that land\nfor exactly the price the person asked. Who, again,\nis the mayor's sister. I didn't buy from her, okay?\nI talked to the man… - So you didn't buy from the owner?\n- I bought from a man who had the paperwork. I signed it, paid,\nend of story. And how did you hit upon this builder,\nRegal WGB Aianis, which is building an identical villa\nfor the mayor on the adjacent plot? Mr Stănescu, this thing about a \"villa\"\nwith a footprint of about 100 m2… Come on, let's get real here\nabout 100 m2 \"villas\"! By Romanian standards, a two-storey house in Sinaia with a view\nof the Bucegi Mountains is a villa. It's a holiday home I hope to get built\nin two years, but I doubt I'll succeed. The outside's done.\nBut how did you find Regal WGB Aianis? - That's my business.\n- It's the mayor's crony, Beniamin Gonț. I don't know whose man he is.\nI know he does good work. I choose contractors\nbased on quality of work and price. REGAL WGB AIANIS SRL\n(latest filings) Owner & manager: Beniamin Gonț\nNature: Restaurants & catering 2022 turnover: RON 2,500\nEmployees: 0\nInsolvency risk: Very high - Mr Oprea chose that builder too.\n- What's that to do with me? Are the house and the land\na favour Mr Oprea did you… Certainly not! - In exchange for…\n- I said certainly not! - Thanks, bye!\n- Thanks, bye! Lucian Bode's show of innocence\nas to the seller's identity was so convincing that we felt compelled\nto double-check our research. But the Land Registry records\ngive the lie to his story. They show the 500 m2 plot\npassed from Anca and Remus David, the mayor's sister and her husband,\nto Bode and his wife, Karina. The idea that Bode is getting a home\nidentical to the mayor's built next door by the same builder without having known\nOprea's family owned the land or that the \"builder\" is close to Oprea\nbeggars belief, especially as the pair\nare so close. I congratulate you,\nVlad Oprea, and the team with whom\nyou're continuing to build the success story\nof a town we're proud of, a historic town,\na town dear to me, steeped in cultural\nand spiritual heritage. You've brought the historic lustre\nof this town to a new level worthy of the coat of arms\nof a town that's a jewel of Romania's national heritage... EPILOGUE Since we wrapped up our filming\nof this investigation, work has finished on Vlad Oprea's\n1,000 m2 mansion in central Sinaia. Predictably,\nVlad Oprea has moved in. Beniamin Gonț can still be seen\nin the yard. He walks Oprea's dogs\nand lets their master in. Open up, Beni! Bode's villa beside Oprea's other home\nis nearing completion. Its exterior and the view give Bode no reason to feel inferior\nto his wealthier peers. As for the chateau in Orthez,\nit too is still a work in progress. So says the Gallic gazette\nthat still pens the odd piece about it. This long and winding story\nmight seem to end here, but the possibility that Oprea's network\nmay have other overseas branches means we can't close the book\non this case just yet. The chatty French farmer\nsays his Romanian neighbours boasted of other foreign boltholes. Were these four or five other houses\nbuilt here? - No, they're all over: Italy...\n- Italy and where else? Also, what's it called...\nAmsterdam. - Amsterdam?\n- Yes, a beauty there. - Another house?\n- Bigger than a house. - Bigger than a house?\n- I think so. The architect's from Orthez, Bonnaventure,\nyou don't know him, he's an architect. - He did all the plans for the chateau.\n- Okay. I got some little gifts\nbecause I'm a neighbour, nice things from there,\nRomania, and he and his family\ngot an invite to Amsterdam. - I'm still waiting for mine!\n- And has the architect been to Amsterdam? - Not yet.\n- Not yet. He told you himself\nhe'd been invited to Amsterdam? Yes, yes!

Secretul pe care Președinția insistă să îl păstreze e altul: cât plătește, în detaliu, pentru această plăcere prezidențială. \n\nÎn luna mai, publicam pe Recorder o demonstrație: la începutul primului său mandat, Klaus Iohannis zbura cu TAROM, iar Administrația Prezidențială își asuma la vedere cheltuielile, până la virgulă.

Acum suntem în filmul în care președintele nu se mai poate deplasa nici măcar de la Constanța la Sibiu fără un avion de lux plătit din bani publici.

I'm Anca Simina.\nLet's take a virtual trip! We’ll go up, up and away\nin President Iohannis' hired jets and come back down to reality. A reality where Romania\nis the only EU nation whose president uses private jets\nand classifies the costs. You may recall\nRecorder's demonstration in May. Early in his first term,\nIohannis flew with TAROM. His office disclosed the costs\ndown to the last penny. In 2014, that's how we imagined\n\"A proper Romania\" would be. But at some point,\nthat film broke down. In the sequel, he can't even go\nfrom Constanța to Sibiu without a luxury jet\ncourtesy of the taxpayer. In the first half of 2023, he flew in five different high-end jets\nin as many months. We wondered\nwhat these flights cost, when they became\nstandard presidential practice, and who decided\nto cover all this up suddenly. Cotroceni keeps giving\nthe same answer. That's the law. Wrong!\nAnd we'll explain why. Thank you. We've spotted several untruths\ntold by Iohannis and his office lately. We'll debunk them,\nto use his catchphrase, step by step. Here's step one! Step 1:\nIOHANNIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD A Romanian-registered Embraer Legacy 600\ntouched down in London on 4 May. Aboard the Toyo Aviation charter jet\nwere Iohannis and his wife. They were among the many VIPs\ninvited to King Charles III's coronation. Our president ignored\nthe British royal family's suggestion of taking commercial flights\nto cut airport crowding and pollution and chartered a 12-seater private jet. As journalists, we wondered where else\nhiring a business jet and hiding the costs was the norm,\nas at Cotroceni. So we asked the offices of the other\npresidents who went to the coronation how long the presidents spent in London, how they got there,\nand what each country paid for transport. Here come the replies. Several European leaders\ntook scheduled flights even though some had official aircraft. Those of the Czech Republic, Estonia,\nFinland, Ireland, Iceland and Latvia did that to slash costs or to practise what they'd preached\nabout the environment. The biggest surprise\nwas the Czech Republic. Its new president, Petr Pavel,\nnot only took a scheduled BA flight, but also paid his own fare\nand his wife's. We even received the bookings. So the Czech president's office\nspent just €1,775 on tickets for three staffers\nwho went with him and his wife. He has an official plane in Prague,\nbut it's costly to run, so he's started plane-sharing\nwith other nations in the region. Here, we see him with\nPresident Maia Sandu of Moldova. Sandu also took\na scheduled flight to London, and her office in Chișinău\nstated all her expenses – even unrequested ones\nlike accommodation and extras. The heads of the European Commission\nand European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel,\ntook scheduled flights too. The presidents' offices\neither gave us the exact fares or assured us, being under no duty\nto inform foreign journalists, that the fares were typical\nfor scheduled flights in the region. But scheduled flights were more of\na political statement than a rule. The presidents who weren't out\nto make a point opted for the comfort\nof their official jets. Nine leaders took\nofficial flights to London: those of France, Germany, Italy\nand Portugal in western Europe, and those of Greece,\nPoland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary in central and eastern Europe. Klaus Iohannis was\nthe only EU head of state to charter a private jet\nespecially for the trip. Now, back to Romanian reality. As we know, although the public pays them,\nflight costs are state secrets here. Public curiosity about them is seen\nalmost as a threat to national security. I can't imagine you'd want to encourage\nsomeone in my office to break the law. That'd be the limit! The limit of transparency.\nUnthinkable at Cotroceni! We wondered how close it would get\nto the other extreme: top secrecy, so we asked it to reveal just the length\nof Mr and Mrs Iohannis' London trip. It said in no uncertain terms that even this detail\nwill be hush-hush until 2033. It turns out that the president’s office\nkeeps official secrets for 10 years, equal to two presidential terms. For now, it's humouring us\nwith a pretence. Posts on social media\nand the official website suggest the first couple\nspent two days in London: 5-6 May,\nas per their official schedule, like the other European leaders\nwho flew in official aircraft. But the reality\nwas more like a city break. The pair's hired jet\ntook off from Otopeni on 4 May, returning to Sibiu on 6 May\nand Bucharest at midnight on 7 May. So say Flightradar24's records, which are public – a slap in the face\nto the notion of presidential secrets. That makes three days, meaning not only more presidential time,\nbut also higher costs. We can't count the night in Sibiu,\nbut it's clear the president's office paid for two nights' accommodation\nin London, not one, and hired the jet\nfor at least three days, not two. We wondered if there were\nlow-cost alternatives in a country with no presidential jet. The Romanian royal family\nindirectly answered that for us. HM Crown Custodian Margareta\nand Prince Radu, who got invites\nas relatives of Charles III, flew in business class\nwith TAROM on 4 and 8 May. RON 9,750 – less than €2,000 –\nwas paid for their tickets, but not from the public purse. So, compared with the rest of Europe, our president's office fails\non transparency and appropriateness. Now let's take step two and look at the cost\nof our jet-setting president's flights. Step 2:\nNOTHING COMPARES TO LUXURY To make best estimates,\nwe spoke to European aviation professionals and asked charter carriers\nfor quotes for jets identical or similar to those hired by Mr Iohannis' office\nfor him in the first half of 2023. Based on the running costs,\nwe estimated the cost of each flight, including stopovers in Sibiu. Here's our breakdown\nfor the first flight in 2023. There's usually also\na profit margin of 10% and a few other costs\nwhen you charter a luxury jet. For example,\nyou pay for a positioning flight. That's when the plane flies\nto the airport you take off from. Jets were brought to the president from as far afield as France,\nSwitzerland and even Sweden at his office's expense. Then there are special telecoms costs, and extra catering costs\nif fine dining is desired. Now let's take Iohannis' London trip\nin the Embraer Legacy 600. The estimated cost of operating this plane\nwith a crew of three and six passengers is about €60,000\nfor the round trip. Profit and a positioning flight from Nice\npush the bill up to €85,000. Dropping the stop in Sibiu\nwould have saved at least €5,000. Back to the bigger picture. Estonia, the Czech Republic,\nLatvia and Finland each spent about €2,000 on flights, but Romania, where GDP per capita is lower,\nsplurged more than 40 times that amount. And it wasn't a one-off. In the first half of 2023,\nCotroceni chartered 15 international flights. Let's take this Dassault Falcon 8X. This 14-seater VIP jet\nhired from Global Jet Luxembourg took Iohannis from Sibiu to Rotterdam\non 27 June for a NATO pre-summit dinner. His office picked a jet\nthat doubles as a flying bedroom for the two-hour hop\nwith a small entourage. Built three years ago,\nit's touted by the charter firm as a benchmark for modern comfort. With a three-strong crew\nand six passengers, a flight like this would set you back\nabout €115,000. If profit and a Geneva-Bucharest\npositioning flight are added, prepare to part with over €170,000. An equally plush Dassault Falcon 7X\nflew from Bucharest-Reykjavik-Sibiu in May, and the president stayed on\nfor a day after his engagement. The industry insiders Recorder spoke to\nput the cost at over €195,000 or, with a Paris-Bucharest\npositioning flight, over €260,000. But Dassault Falcons pale in comparison\nwith the VIP jet that whisked Iohannis off\nto Asia and South America this spring. The renowned\nBoeing Business Jet 737 Extended Range has a minimum running cost\nof €22,000 per hour. Wi-Fi adds a whopping €1,000 or so\nto the hourly bill. With a small crew, standard catering for 20\nand a positioning flight from Paris, the president's Asian adventure in March\ncomes to over €1 million. Interestingly, skipping the Sibiu detour\nwould have shaved off at least €35,000. The difference isn't just down to\nfuel and landing fees. Even just running the engine\nwhile parked is expensive, so stopovers and take-off delays\ncost all the more. On 4 March,\nafter the pit stop in Sibiu, the jet took off\n32 minutes behind schedule. In April, it was recalled from Paris\nto Bucharest for the Latin America tour. It stopped in Brazil,\nChile and Argentina. Including the positioning flight, this itinerary's estimated price tag\ntops €1.2 million. Tours of other continents in VIP jets\nmay seem like an extravagance, but Iohannis takes that concept\nto a whole new level. On 29 June, he was expected at\na European Council meeting in Brussels – a trip he makes at least four times a year,\nusually in an Embraer Legacy 600, for an estimated €60,000-€80,000\ndepending on stops and the positioning flight. But this time,\nthe president was unlucky. Or rather, the taxpayer was, as passenger\nKlaus Iohannis only stands to gain. His usual Embraer jet from Toyo\nset off for Bucharest from Bratislava, but tracking apps show\nit soon returned to base. So the president's office\ngot straight on the phone to Global Jet. It laid on a Gulfstream G650ER\nbuilt last year. One of the priciest of small planes, this deluxe model\nis highly rated in the business. A bonus for customers\nwith big enough wallets is that it's invisible to Flightradar24,\na widely used tracking app. But it can be tracked\nin less well-known apps, especially if you know\ndetails like the ID number. So we did just that. This jet flew\nfrom Sweden to Bucharest, where Iohannis had attended\na function the night before. It then flew to Sibiu\nfor reasons unknown, as leaders' partners needn't sit in\non European Council meetings. Next stop: Brussels. Afterwards, Iohannis flew\nto Constanța, not Bucharest, and spent the weekend at his official pad\nin Neptun with an empty diary. Including the long positioning flight,\nthe round trip in a Gulfstream G650ER works out at over €200,000 –\ntreble what previous Brussels runs cost. Now, another comparison. For Ursula von der Leyen's return flights\nto Bucharest from Brussels, the European Commission\npays about €3,500 as she takes commercial flights\nwhenever possible. When Iohannis makes the same round trip\nin reverse by private jet, his office pays\n20-60 times as much. The annual cost of our frequent flyer’s luxury\nclimbs ever skywards. By this June,\n2023 was already a record-smashing year. This raises a big question. Based on all the experts' estimates, the flights taken in the first half of 2023\nshould have cost less. €1 million less. One reason might be extra costs\nnot factored into the estimates, such as satcom systems,\nnavigation, or parking fees on days\nwhen jets stayed on the ground. VIP passengers' special requests\ncan also, in part, bump costs up, but if any were made,\nthe details are bound to be classified! Another explanation: a sky-high price\nwas agreed in a backroom bidding process. All this conjecture could have been avoided\nhad Iohannis decided, when the media began exposing\nthe secrecy at Cotroceni, that his office should come clean\nabout the costs. But he didn't exercise that power. On the contrary,\nhe made out he was powerless. That's the law,\nwhether we like it or not. We can talk\nand maybe change it. So \"we\", Klaus Iohannis, implied that\nclassification had never been up to \"us\". The message from the top\nwas that he was obeying, in good faith, a law he'd had no say in. So our third step\nwas to fact-check that information. Step 3:\nWHO RUNS THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE? First, we wanted to know if trip details\nhad been secret before Iohannis' time, as Cotroceni Palace had intimated. In May, we publicly asked\nthe president's office why details of his flights\nhad been accessible in 2015, yet were classified in 2023. It didn't explain,\nand said it would investigate how top-secret info\nhad got out years ago. So it hinted at a security breach.\nIt didn't elaborate when pressed. It also said details were classified\nunder a law predating 2015. So we asked Traian Băsescu,\nKlaus Iohannis' predecessor, if he'd laid down a rule at Cotroceni\nthat hid this info from public view. - Hello, I'm Anca Simina from Recorder.\n- Hello, yes. We're looking into official secrets\nat the president's office, and some old information\nwould be helpful. When you left office, did you take\na decision at Cotroceni or pass a law... Do you know of any law that classified\nthe costs of your trips abroad? Madam, nothing to do with trips\nwas classified. The lists of the people\nwho went with me were published. The media people accredited at Cotroceni\nwere usually all on board the plane, so this tosh about\npresidential trips being secret is just another case of\n\"Let's blame Băsescu\". There's no way the costs of presidential trips\nwere ever classified. When you were in office,\nyou mean? That's right. So here's a first flaw\nin the president's arguments: travel costs were classified by his office,\nnot the previous administration. And Cotroceni once\nlet slip as much to us officially. The classification rules in place there now\nwere decreed in 2018, nearly four years\nafter Klaus Iohannis took office. He'd already made\na few private jet flights by then, but foreign policy\nwasn't his focus at first. Most of his trips were to Brussels. Only in 2022, post-pandemic,\ndid he start globetrotting in VIP jets, and he covered up the costs\nfor all of his years in office. So the new reality is over-classification.\nOver-classification after the fact. But did a law dictate it,\nas Iohannis says? To find that out,\nstay tuned, because a politician's claims –\neven the president's – have to be checked. To do that,\nwe kept firing questions at his office. Straightforward queries like\nwhen, why and by whom presidential travel costs had been\nhushed up went unanswered for ages. The office seemed to want\nto keep us in the dark rather than shed light\non procedures. We decided to put\nits repeated references to Article 7 of the National Official Secrets Standards\nunder the microscope. This paragraph explains\nhow official secrets are classified by all institutions,\nnot just the president's office. The head makes a list of categories\nof classified information based on some criteria. One requirement is that disclosure would be detrimental\nto the institution's interests. It's hard to see how the president's office\nwould suffer if the public found out how much of its money\na flight had cost. Unless, that is, the office's interests\nwere confused with those of our president, whose public image\ncertainly could take a hit! Let's come back to the key detail\nin the Official Secrets Act: official secrets are identified\nby heads of institutions. At the president’s office,\nthat duty falls to President Klaus Iohannis. But instead of taking that for granted, we asked Cotroceni\nthe simplest of questions: who runs the president's office? The roundabout reply surprised us:\nthe list of official secrets was approved by Mr George-Vladimir Duhan,\na presidential advisor. So an ex-parliamentary assistant\nfrom the PNL signed a very important order\nat the age of just 34 while still a newcomer in the office. How an advisor got to exercise a power\nreserved by law for the head is unclear, but it beggars belief\nthat he'd have taken such a big decision without the president's say-so. That'd be the limit! Time for some takeaways. First and foremost, the president's claim,\n\"That's the law\", doesn't stack up. The Official Secrets Act doesn't classify\nflight costs for official trips. It just says a list of information types\nmust be drawn up by heads of institutions. Which brings us to a second conclusion:\nif heads decide what's classified, they can also declassify information. The law Mr Iohannis insists\nhe obeys to the letter gives the head of his office that power\nand directly obliges the head to put his name and signature\nat the end of all classified documents. Only information bearing his signature\ncan become an official secret. So Iohannis has no excuse\nfor concealing the costs of his trips, unless he's secretly quit\nas head of his office, a post to which he was elected. Days ago, the government handed\nanother RON 7.5 million to his office, which had used up its annual travel budget\nby 30 September. I believe in democracy and freedom. I believe in doing politics in earnest\nand respecting people. I believe in the law and fairness. I'll be a president\nwho respects you, represents you with decency\nand values you. President Iohannis has hinted\nthat if it matters to a lot of us, the flight cost classification rule\ncould be changed. Recorder's website has a counter\nshowing how many people want that. Write to the president at\nwww.recorder.ro/transparenta We wonder how many people\na president can ignore. And for how long.

Didn't you hear that we are the best? It's a... We were happy when we saw that it was 80 per cent. The recyclables?  That's bullshit. What they're declaring is illegal! I also don't think they can reach these percentages either. That's why I brought the ladies from the technical department. Say. What qualifies you to be the president of this institution? I’m young, I love working. OK, darling. We believed what they told us. They must have gotten these quantities from somewhere. Twenty-five million seems huge to me. Three million tons? I don’t think so... It’s a bit too much... A bit too much. Yes, this is what we send to Eurostat. Do you think they’re real? Yes, they’re real. Validate means automatically \nbelieving it and then forwarding it? Yes. This is what's wrong with this country: everyone lies. Recycling in Romania \nChaos, corruption and incompetence  Romania had many years at its disposal to align\n itself with European waste management laws,  increasing the recycling rate \nbeing one of the main objectives. Starting with 2020, the European Union\n has also set recycling targets which each member state must achieve. But instead of getting close to these targets, our country has begun to regress in terms of recycling rates, dropping to eleven per cent in 2021. Professional services must be created\n to divert from the landfill and  reach a 50-60 per cent recycling performance. Politicians are used to talking points, \nwhich include \"we have to\" and \"we will\", although 16 years have passed\n since joining the European Union, during which we had everything necessary  to get close to the civilised states. Europe showed us the solutions, and gave us money to implement them, but Romania continues to be suffocated by waste. Employees from the Water Management Service \nlooked with horror at the disaster. They collected a massive pile\n of PETs from the Olt River in two days, but there still is a long way to go. It'll take at least four days to get everything on the shore. The same conclusion usually accompanies such images: we are a society that cannot be educated. And this simplistic and wrong explanation is convenient to those who \nare really responsible for solving the problem. Because it's easier to say: \"It can't be done\", than implementing a system that \nhas shown its effectiveness in other countries. With recycling, the citizens \nare the first and most important link. They are responsible for separating \ntheir waste into at least two fractions: wet and dry. The sanitation company is next in the recycling chain, which must come with \na different truck to pick up recyclable waste. If the glass, plastic or paper were collected together,  the car transports the waste to a sorting station. Here, they are divided into categories. All recyclable waste ends up here. From the sorting belt, they are divided\n into the categories recyclers accept them in. After sorting, the waste is sold to recycling centres,  which process them to be reused. The trucks arrive here and are put on the scales.  After that, the material is chopped,  washed,  and turned into flakes. This is where the first recycling step ends: \nfrom waste to a reusable material. But for this whole mechanism to function,  one more component is essential: the state institutions. In addition to the local institutions which should provide \nthe citizens with the right infrastructure to sort waste, at the central level, we have three institutions \nresponsible for the propper function of the entire system. The National Environmental Protection Agency, NEPA, is the institution that issues environmental authorisations\n for any company involved in waste management: sanitation companies,  sorting stations,  and waste processing centres. The authorisations issued \nby NEPA dictate every detail of their activity, drawing very strict rules. The Environmental Guard is the institution that\n has to verify in the field the compliance of the authorisations and sanction companies that violate the law. The third important institution is \nthe Environment Fund Administration, EFA, which collects environmental taxes\n from both companies and local government. With the collected taxes, EFA\n allocates funds for environmental protection programs. Both NEPA and EFA receive data on\n the amount of waste collected in Romania, and what happens with it. EFA receives this data from all town halls across the country, who in turn get them from the companies \nwith whom they have a waste management contract. NEPA receives them directly from the waste companies, so, the data obtained by the two institutions has the same source. So, in theory, the Romanian state has all the necessary levers\nto ensure that the system works as intended: it can follow the route of the waste and track the activity of the companies involved in this process, it has funds through which it can educate \nthe population and encourage recycling, and it has statistical data based on which \nit can carry out checks and sanction companies. But why doesn't the system work? In search of an answer, we requested both NEPA and the EFA to send us the data regarding the quantities of waste collected from the population in the last six years. The first thing that stood out was \nthe huge difference between their data. There are years when there are differences \nof several hundred thousand tons and years with variations of tens of millions of tons. Even though both institutions measure the same thing: the total amount of municipal waste \ngenerated on the territory of Romania. Our first reaction was to return \nto the Environment Fund Administration since a typo could've slipped through \nin their initial response to the Recorder newsroom. The same country can't generate\n five million tons of waste in a year and seven times more in the following year. However, EFA replied that there was no mistake  and that that is the data they have. Amazed that no one within the institution seemed to consider these quantities suspicious, we requested an interview with \nthe president of EFA, Laurențiu Neculaescu, hoping he would be willing \nto provide a coherent explanation. Hello. Laurențiu Neculaescu? Yes, hello. My name is Isabela Pop, and I’m a journalist at Recorder. I’m calling because I’m working on a story on waste management,  and I would like to ask if you are willing to give us an interview, maybe this week? Yes... I'm out of the country until Wednesday, but... Yeah, I don't know, give me a call on Wednesday and we'll talk. OK, thank you. Goodbye. You have reached the voicemail… The president of the EFA didn't answer our calls anymore, even though we sent him messages  requesting an explanation regarding\n the huge discrepancies in the statistics of the institution he leads. We tried to seek an answer \nfrom the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), the other institution \nthat collects data on waste in Romania. Here, we found more openness. We met with the NEPA’s president, Laurențiu Păștinaru, a 30-year-old man who boasts in the press that \nhis youth, ambition, and law-abidingness are his greatest assets. Păștinaru was accompanied \nby two senior subordinates in the institution. EFA receives the data from the town halls. Yes. NEPA receives the data from waste management companies. Should they be equal? The municipal waste ones, yes. OK. Let's look here. I've pointed out some very, very big differences in this data here. Let's look at 2017, for example. 2017... According to the NEPA data,  five million tons of waste were collected in Romania. According to EFA’s  data,  25 million tons of municipal waste were collected in Romania. Twenty-five million? Yes, that's what the EFA told us. Not even Germany has this quantity. It seems huge to me. Twenty-five million. Honestly. So this amount really seems huge to me. Twenty-five million... We are talking about the same garbage. How do you explain this difference? Please explain.  I'd like to hear an explanation from you. I also want to understand why, \nthe ladies were here in 2019, I wasn't. And I would also like to know. Some town halls may declare \ntheir quantities in kilograms instead of tons. Where the data is smaller at the EFA, maybe not all town halls filled out the form and informed the state. Generally, we are talking about the same thing and believe in a void they should have the same value. But, there may be differences in definition, interpretation, or understanding of the terms. What is your explanation? Exactly this explanation. The reluctance with which the head of NEPA \nvalidates this possible explanation, and the embarrassment of his subordinates\nprove, without a doubt,  how unreliable the data of the Romanian state is.  This chaos could be dissipated if the Romanian institutions \nwould do some minimal checks on the data they collect. We wanted to see how the reporting system \nbetween town halls and the EFA works, so we chose a county  and asked all the town halls to send us their waste data.  We chose the Argeș county, and as the answers started coming in,\nwe quickly identified a first anomaly. Bradu, a town next to Pitești,\ninformed us that in 2021,  almost three million tons of waste \nwas collected from its 8,000 residents. That's more than was collected in the same year in Croatia, whose population is four million. We went to the Bradu City Hall, looking for an explanation. Deputy? Yes. I have here some children, so to speak, journalists, from… From a newsroom from Bucharest. Yes, go, go. Hello. We came here to see if there \nis an explanation for these three million, and whether this data was also sent to the EFA. What do you know? Three million tons? Well, I don't think so... it's wrong. Look, here. A draft of our reply. Yes, I don’t know... Well, wait a minute, we need to talk \nto the environmental inspector Dragoș Bălan. Who wrote this answer? Well, Balan. Ahh... Well, he should come... It’s a comma. Yes, yes, it's a typo. What did you send to the EFA? Was it like that? No, these were not sent to the EFA; it was just to you and  probably, not probably, definitely, somewhere in here... Because this is the data we received \nfrom the waste management company. There's a comma here; it's two thousand-two hundred. Yes, yes, yes. Here is a comma, and so on.  It's a typo. We sent it correctly to the EFA. Oh, and a thousand recycled, two thousand collected. Yes. Our performance is good. From this point of view, it's excellent... Yes. So, the state has the correct data.  Yes, yes, yes. The colleague... There was an error there... The colleague... No, that would have been... yeah. The employees of the Bradu town hall claim that the waste data was wrong only in the answer sent to the Recorder newsroom, while the EFA received the correct numbers. Even so, seeing how easily a city hall \ncan make a mistake in reporting the data and given that the EFA does \nnot seem to verify the figures received, we have a possible explanation for the discrepancies of tens of millions of tons from the statistics of these institutions.  We are left with the NEPA statistics, which seem more consistent from year to year. But can we rely on this data? If yes, it would mean that all the mistakes\n in the reporting system are made only by the counties, while the waste companies report the correct data. We go back to the numbers \nwe received from all over the Argeș county and we notice another anomaly: most city halls, all that have \na contract with the same sanitation company, have a great recycling percentage,  way above the national average of 11 percent. At the same time, there are town halls with low percentages, \nwhose contracts are with another sanitation firm. This also raised our suspicions regarding \nthe data declared by the waste management companies. So we go to Râca, the village with \nthe highest recycling rate in the county.  Sixty-nine per cent of the waste \ngenerated by the villagers ends up recycled. Do you separate the plastic and paper at home? Ah, no, not separately.  We don’t have... You have to put them somewhere separate, not just burn it. And you have nowhere to throw it? No, we only have one bin. And even that needs to be bigger. But you don't get different trash bags for recyclable waste? No, not at Râca. For sure not, I used to be a deputy, I know. In Romania, the recycling rate is around 15-16 per cent. We could also reach that level here.  But do you know the rate of Râca? For recycling? Seventy. That's bullshit. What they're declaring is illegal. What do you mean? You can film me saying it: it’s illegal. This is what's wrong with this country: everyone lies. We follow the car that comes to pick up recyclable waste,  and we see that it only stops at the local shops. We are good here; we do everything the right way. Didn't you hear that we are the best? It's a... We follow the rules, you know. You do, but if there is an older citizen that lives \nhalf a kilometre from here, will he come and bring the bags here? Ah, these are just mine. Well, no, miss, he's not coming... Do you know what they are doing now? \nThe older people throw it in the stove. Easy! They don't throw cardboard away, everything goes in the stove.  Noticing that we are monitoring their activity,  the people from the sanitation company start \nhanding out bags for recyclable waste to the villagers. Why are you handing out bags now? Well, so they recycle with them. But why now? You haven't done this until now. No, I have. Where? We passed other streets earlier, \nand you didn't give out any there. Yes, I did, in the back.  But how come you got this idea just now? I didn't, I've always done it this way. Do you know what that is? He threw something in your yard. What did he throw? Do you know what that is? I don't know. What is it, darling, what's it for? Did you ever get something like this before? No, what is it, honey? For recycling. What? For the trash? Or what for? Yes. Yes? I didn't know.  Did you receive this before? No. What's this for? Tell me. For recyclable waste. What's that? Paper, plastic, cardboard. Glass as well? Glass. In them? Yes. OK, honey.  Do you know what this is for? For waste? Yes, for recyclables. For plastic? Plastic, paper... Have you ever received a bag like this before? No, not here. I've been here for only a year, but no.  But will it be recycled with the garbage? The car comes once a month, didn't you know that? This one? Recyclable, as in electrical waste? For plastic, paper... I saw a green car pass by \nbut thought it was for electrical waste. We talk to the mayor of Râca, to find out his explanation \nregarding the almost 70 per cent recycling rate, given that apart from a few shops, \nno one in the village separates their waste. In total, 170 tons of garbage were collected. Yes. And let's look at the total recycled: 120 tons. Yes. Yes, ten... I don't know what to tell you... We believed what they told us. Where did you get this data from? Who sends it to you? From Financiar Urban, the sanitation company, they send them... And do you trust them? Well, what can I do? If they don't... should I challenge them, or what should I do? What can I tell you? These are the documents,\nthis is the reality on the ground,  what can I tell you? But do you realise that the reality\n does not correspond to the papers? The percentage may be too high,\n but not that it doesn't correspond. Well, if the amount is too large \non paper and in reality it isn't... They must have gotten these \nquantities from somewhere, I don't know where from or... It's bad if we do something, it's bad if we don't. You go to school, take a test, write an exam,\nand know your performance was worth a seven,  but the teacher gives you a nine or a ten.\nAre you going to let the teacher know? Would you have done that?\nYou took so many exams, would you have appealed? So that's your attitude. Well, it's not my attitude, but what could we have done? \nWe were happy when we saw that it was 80 per cent. What else could we have done? Ask them why it's 80 and not 30 per cent \nbecause we didn't do anything to get that? Suppose the town halls are happy when the companies \nsend them much more favourable data than in reality.  In that case, the National Environmental Protection Agency \nshould react to suspicious data  provided by waste management companies. This is from Argeș County in 2021. And I highlighted the percentages of recycled, recovered. We have town halls with a percentage \nof recycled and recovered waste of 87 or 90. Look. Do you think this is possible? To actually recycle that, no. I also don't think they can reach these percentages either. You saw the data of the town halls \nand said you didn't think they were real. The recycling ones.  The town halls receive the data from the sanitation companies. Yes. And the sanitation companies send you the same data. Yes, but not about the recycling rates. But what data do they send you? Well, reports on general waste management. And what quantities are there? That's precisely why I brought the ladies \nfrom the technical department with me,  so they explain the procedure and the data we receive. Tell me about... No, please, I'd like to talk to you.  Well, that's what I'm telling you, these are \ntechnical questions, I'm the institution's manager. This is not a technical question. \nI'm just asking what data you receive. It's a simple question. These reports, look. And what's in the reports? But I sent you... I gave you these reports, look. And what's in these reports? The data. OK, you receive some data. Yes. \"We picked up 50 tons of waste from commune X.\" How do you know if 50 tons have actually been picked up? The Guard! The Guard checks if they are OK, if what they sent is right, if they are following their environmental permit. We tried to find out if the \nEnvironmental Guard actually checks, but the people from the head \nof the institution passed us around from one to the other until they stopped answering their phone. You have reached the voicemail... We tried to find out if NEPA, the institution that collects the data, \nnotifies the Guard if it notices suspicious quantities. But if the Environmental Guard \ndoes not receive the data and the NEPA receives the data, I understand that NEPA is the first \nthat can say \"something wrong here.\". They can check, correct. How do they check? If we have some uncertainties regarding the data they sent, \nwe notify the Environmental Guard. And has this happened? Honestly...  No, regarding uncertainties of the reported data, no. The Environmental Guard certainly checks, I can tell you that for sure, especially the waste management companies,  they check every two to three months \none hundred per cent, and you can ask the Guard yourself. From the top of an institution with more than 2,000 employees and branches throughout the country, Laurentiu Paștinaru seems \nto convey helplessness and ineffectiveness. And that seems to contaminate the whole institution. When we talk about state structures\n that can protect the environment, their helplessness ends up looking like this. These images are filmed right on the edge of the town of Costești, which on paper has a recycling percentage of over 50 per cent. The situation is similar around Râca, the commune with the highest \npercentage of recycling in Argeș, 69 per cent. But the contrast between state \nstatistics and reality has another explanation  rather than the incompetence of some institutions. The inflated figures in the documents \nhide substantial financial interests, which oscillate between the administration \nand the business environment. The EFA imposes an annual \nrecycling target for all town halls in the country, and the law states that every ton of waste \nbelow the target is taxed. Therefore, the mayors are interested in having\n a high recycling percentage, because that helps them avoid environmental taxes. And instead of creating recycling conditions, many chose to accept the inflated \nfigures received from sanitation companies. But what interest do these companies \nhave in reporting unreal statistics? Here, the answer is much more complicated, but understanding it is necessary, because it affects the taxes we pay and the air we breathe. Everything starts from a principle inspired by \nWestern countries and applied in the purest Romanian way: it's called the Extended Producer Responsibility.  This means that every manufacturer or importer  that brings products packaged in \nrecyclable materials to the Romanian market has the legal responsibility to finance the recycling of at least 65 per cent of the total \namount of packaging it has generated. A bakery must contribute to the recycling \nof the bags in which it sells its bread, a yoghurt company is obliged by law to pay for the recycling of the containers\n in which they sell their products, and a company that imports juices must contribute to the recycling of the PETs sold with the drink. If they don't, and the packaging ends up in the landfills, these producers must pay the EFA a contribution of 2 RON for each kilogram \nof packaging whose recycling they did not finance and which ends up being deposited in a landfill. It is a considerable amount because many manufacturers \ngenerate tens or hundreds of tons of packaging, so their interest is to boost recycling. For them to do that, the law allows \nthem to rely on some intermediaries who they pass on their responsibility. These intermediaries are called OIREPs, \norganisations in which several producers partner up and which can only be established\n with the approval of the Ministry of the Environment. In Romania, there are currently \n16 OIREPs serving packaging manufacturers. A manufacturer that has to finance\n the recycling of 65 tons of plastic can pay an OIREP, who would take over this responsibility in exchange \nfor an amount of about 0.5 lei per kilogram, a quarter of the 2 lei fee that the producer would pay to the EFA. The OIREP is then looking for a waste collector in the market who can prove to him that he recycled 65 tons of plastic and pays it on behalf of the manufacturer. In the end, packaging manufacturers save significant amounts, companies involved in the recycling process earn extra money, and the state obtains high recycling percentages. As you may have already noticed, the entire functioning of this system depends decisively on the amount of waste that collectors claim to have recycled. This helps us clarify the problem we started from: what the interest of sanitation companies\n is to declare as much recycled waste as possible. The scam was discovered this year when anti-fraud inspectors went to check seven companies. According to the documents, between 2018 \nand 2019, they handled the collection  and recycling of a vast amount\n of packaging and PET waste: 8,400 tons. Paradoxically, the state detects such frauds very late, after the companies carry out their criminal activity for years. Even though it has an electronic system  in which all those involved in the recycling \nprocess enter data in real-time. The company that collects the waste \nuploads the collected amount into the system. The sorting station that receives the waste \nmust also report the amount received into the system, and the final processor that recycles the waste confirms in the electronic system \nthe quantity arrived at his factory. So, for the collection company to declare fictitious data, the other entities need to validate his lie. A simple suspicious number is enough \nfor the state to carry out checks on the entire circuit and detect the fraud. The suspicious numbers are everywhere, \nbut no one seems to look at them. And let’s look at the total recycled: 120 tons. Yes. I don't have an explanation for that.  So, the total is 173 tons. The papers that the mayor of the Râca looks at with bewilderment state that 170 tons of waste were collected in a year of which no less than 120 tons have been recycled. The mayor also admits that the figures are unrealistic. Yes, it's a bit big, the difference is bit too big. We'll check. We'll see, we'll talk to the company \nto see how they end up with this amount. Financiar Urban is the largest waste collector in Argeș County. It is owned by Gheorghe Văsîi, a businessman recently sentenced  to four years in prison for complicity in abuse of office in a case in which the former mayor of Pitești, \nTudor Pendiuc, was also convicted. Financiar Urban is the main waste company\n in Argeș, and in the latest available data they reported a recycling average of over 50 percent. The investigation started from a landfill in Argeș. The Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime \nand Terrorism (DIICOT) made thirty-three searches  in a file targeting a group allegedly \nobtaining millions of lei from fictitious recycling In the spring of this year, DIICOT prosecutors  announced the investigation of an \norganised criminal group from Argeș county, whose way of operating focused on \ndeclaring fictitious amounts of recyclable waste and collecting as much money as possible from OIREPs. DIICOT also states that this organised\n criminal group acted for ten years. All this time, institutions such as \nthe EFA and NEPA gave authorisations to these companies, accepted more than suspicious reports and passively assisted as the state budget was being defrauded. We started documenting this story  with the desire to understand why Romania recycles so little and we reached the conclusion that the Romanian state \ndoes not know, in fact, how much is actually being recycled. In our country, recycling seems like a dirty business where everyone has an interest in declaring fictitious quantities, and the state institutions do nothing to stop this way of operating. It reports, however, to Brussels an annual recycling rate \nthat is at a shameful distance from the European targets. The tragedy is that even\n these ridiculous percentages appear to be fictitious. The president of NEPA, the institution \nthat reports the data to the European Union,  is as convincing as possible. NEPA sends this data to the European Union. Yes. Do you think that it's real? Yes. It is real. Why? Because this is the data we receive, we validate it and send it. Validate means automatically believing it and then forwarding it? Yes. Yes, this is what we send to Eurostat. What qualifies you to be the president of this institution? What qualifies me as president? I work in the environmental field, I want to do good things; I want to \nmake the environment in Romania do better and better. I'm fighting, I'm young, I love working. Your good intentions, although admirable, \nare not enough to run an institution. Believe me, you will see that we will do well \nand the national and local agencies  will have a very good activity while I am here. However, it’s more important to know \nwhat the institution does, what data it receives. I know what the institution does. You honestly haven't proven that so far. That's because you don't want to... I know the model of the show, and I understand it. I saw how you presented the problem, thank you."}

Valul de plecări a crescut, în ciuda anunțurilor despre investiții uriașe pentru înzestrare militară. \n\nProblemele sistemice au determinat zeci de angajați din Armată să tragă un semnal de alarmă, în ciuda regulamentelor militare care le interzic să vorbească public. În ultimele luni, Recorder a stat de vorbă cu o parte dintre acești militari cărora le este imposibil să mai tacă. Unii dintre ei au părăsit recent sistemul, dezamăgiți și deziluzionați. Alții încă mai rezistă, animați doar de speranța că poate lucrurile se vor schimba.\n\n-----------------------------\nRecorder este o publicație online construită de o echipă de jurnaliști în jurul acestor principii: jurnalism onest, făcut cu pasiune și pus în serviciul public. \n\nMai multe clipuri produse de noi sunt pe: \n\nsite: https://www.recorder.ro\n\npagina noastră de Facebook https://www.facebook.com/myrecorder\n\ncontul de Instagram https://www.instagram.com/recorder.ro/\n\nNe puteți urmări și pe Telegram: https://t.me/redactia_recorder", "transcript": "When it comes to trust in institutions... First, the Army, as usual, 65%... The Army, the Academy and the Church\nare among our most trusted institutions. The Army is one of Romania's most respected\nand least transparent institutions. The little information that the public\ngleans through unofficial channels raises a question that's hard to ignore:\nwhat's really going on in the Army? Just seconds later,\nthe APC sinks. We have to admit\nthat strange things can happen. The grenade exploded\nbefore it left the barrel. - Misfire!\n- Misfire! Misfire! That's the inside,\nbloody hell! The problems have spurred some in the Army\nto break the rules by speaking out. Hi! I work in the Romanian Armed Forces,\nin the Navy. I've been in the Romanian Army\nfor about 20 years. - How's army life?\n- Great! - How's army life?\n- It's something else! I've been working\nfor the Ministry of Defence for 17 years. I've been in the Land Forces\nfor over 10 years. I've been a Romanian Army officer\nfor 20 years. We have problems\nthat aren't talked about... Recorder has obtained\na Defence Staff report stating that the number of departures\nbecame critical in 2021 and urgent action was needed. \"In 2021, the turnover\nof military personnel was 14.6%... above the critical level of 10%...\" We're preparing for\ndefence combat missions. Look, Mr Iohannis! The military clothes...\nLook at them! These are staying. Those are going. The saddest moment for me\nis in the evening, when I have to sign off\na lot of resignations from the military. My name's Ciprian-Nicolae Toderaș, I'm 22.\nI worked for the Ministry of Defence. My name's Silviu-Alexandru Deac,\nI'm 27. I was a soldier\nin two Mountain Huntsmen units. My name's Claudiu-Gabriel Brindea,\nI'm 22. I'm a reservist warrant officer\nas I just quit the Army. Army resignations,\nlast 3 years It's strange,\nbecause the Army's in tatters now. It feels like we're just\ngoing through the motions. Morale's near zero. There's bad management and leadership,\nyou're tormented for low pay. Why stay? A FAREWELL TO ARMS\nThe Romanian Army as resignations hit a new high This is in Câmpia Turzii. They were towing each other\nwith something stronger than a strap as one got stuck. I was a Mountain Huntsman\nin the Land Forces. I specialised as a mortar fire controller. After I finished Year 12,\nI spent six months job-hunting. I considered going abroad\nbut didn't have the opportunity. A friend and I\nheard they were recruiting. We decided to give it a go.\nIt was a secure job, why not? The recruiters showed us\nthese cool images of people jumping out of helicopters,\nall these weapons... It looked great! You couldn't wait to join,\ndo it yourself, jump, go, shoot... I realise now\nthey were special troops. And the equipment suggests\nthey weren't even Romanian. It seemed like a stable place where\nyou could work your way up: NCO, officer... There was patriotism,\na sense of doing something important, protecting your family... Quite simply, I joined up after seeing\na Ministry of Defence ad on Facebook during a recruitment drive. I'd heard nothing bad about the Army,\nno scandals. There was an element of patriotism,\nas I chose to join, but for me as a young person aged 18, it was more about\na sense of achievement. Then I sat the end-of-training exams, I was assigned to\na military unit in Arad County, and I began my career\nas an NCO, a sergeant. I'll show you the uniform. I've kept it because I have to reimburse them for it. This is \"town dress\". What we usually wear. For Navy Day,\nthere's this ceremonial uniform. It's just for special occasions. You expected job security,\na bright future. What I heard and saw,\nincluding online, pointed to discipline,\nplus sport, which I loved, and unity,\nlike a band of brothers. Right after sixth form college,\nI went to the Naval Warrant Officer School. I was in for a bit of a surprise! The order and discipline\nreally appealed to me. And the commitment to what they did.\n\"I'll defend and lay down my life.\" You come with certain expectations. The reality's such a shock\nthat you wonder why you came, what you did wrong. Lots of people react by resigning. In the summer of 2022, for example,\nwe had over 20 resignations. When I joined the unit in Arad,\nI was a bit shocked. I still am. Morale was rock bottom. People turned up at work wondering\nwhether they should keep coming or not. After school, I was assigned\nto a ship in Mangalia. The people were very... My impression was\nthat they were quite sad. At the age of 40-50,\ncoming to work upset, sad about having to stay\nfor hours or a 24-hour shift... Quite sad. Morale was quite low. After all the buzz about\njoining up and doing all this stuff, people didn't know\nwhat to do any more. How to leave... There comes a point where you can't go on. FACILITIES & EQUIPMENT Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă\nSOURCE: YouTube/Guvernul României There ARE units where things\nare good or even great. But sadly, very few. In many isolated units, there's sadness.\nThe barracks haven't been done up in years. An old unit, old windows,\nbroken in places... It was newly painted,\nbut the toilets weren't. Cracked mirrors, out-of-order basins.\nThey were SO old. There were 52 of us in one dormitory.\nWe got to shower once a week at first. The unit in Arad\ndidn't have enough toilets. The ones it had\nhad seen better days! Showering was scary. It'd be optimistic to say\nthe beds were from World War 2. Extremely old,\ntorn mattresses... Just a disaster. To have a minimum of comfort,\nwe pay for renovations ourselves. We club together to renovate\nand maintain the bathroom. The most pathetic thing\nI've had to do in the Army was telling a serviceman\nwho visited the sub-unit that we had to buy\ntoilet paper and soap for the toilets ourselves. Yes, that problem's now solved. We don't buy soap\nfor the toilets any more. But the equipment and buildings\nare no better. Buildings that were,\nand are, in disrepair, visibly decaying,\nfalling down... The ceiling of the first floor fell in. I was at a meeting, and as barracks warden, I did an inspection\nand wrote a report. Witnesses said people had been downstairs.\nMiraculously, no one was hurt. But if you walked along the path\nbeside the buildings, when the wind blew, you saw broken tiles lying there. They were cleared,\nthen more appeared. It was clearly a fluke that no one\nhad been killed or badly hurt. The military's acute need\nfor new vehicles came to light dramatically\nlast year in June, when a truck carrying 13 troops\nfrom the 30th Mountain Huntsmen Battalion overturned in a ravine in Argeș. Three soldiers died.\nThe driver said the brakes had failed. In 2019, the Army signed a deal worth\nover RON 1 billion to replace old trucks. By November 2022,\nonly 500 of the 2,900 new vehicles had been delivered by the supplier. Maybe some units\nwere treated to an extra truck, but I've worked\nwith trucks older than me. In the Army, we improvise. That’s the inside,\nbloody hell! I don't know if we ever set off in a truck without hitting problems within 2 km,\nlike having to tow it back or a driver struggling to fix it,\nas drivers have to double up as mechanics. Some trucks are so old\nthat they fail inspections. \"SERVICE BRAKE FADE...\" Once, I saw a truck driver\nleft holding a steering wheel that had broken off from the steering column\nwhile the truck was moving. That truck still has steering wheel\nissues now, some time later. Loads of the trucks\nwere just wrecks. Parts weren't available\nor repairable any more, people got hold of them\nfrom wherever. Most of the drivable trucks\nhad pretty major issues, like the steering or braking. Out of every five vehicles we had,\nwe could usually get two going. Like when people had Trabants and five\nneighbours lent each other alternators. Air Force officers and pilots\ntell me it happens to them too. They don't have stocks of parts, they take\nbits from three planes to get one airborne. It's the same with choppers. On missions with copter crews,\nI asked about the big vibrations. I was told the copters\nwere from the '70s. THE ROMANIAN NAVY A lot of the ships need major repairs\nor are ready for the scrapyard. The ones that are photographed more often\nare tarted up for show. The small auxiliary vessels are like...\nHow can I put this? Skips. Their hulls are rusty and we've had incidents where,\nwithin 24 hours, a ship sprang a leak\nat the quay, not at sea. For really big events,\nlike Navy Day or open days, the ship was polished,\nrepainted, sandblasted... Just the visible bits\nwere spruced up a lot. Ladies and gentlemen, His Excellency President Klaus Werner Iohannis\nof Romania is arriving with Mr Angel Tîlvăr,\nSecretary of State for Defence, and Vice Admiral Mihai Panait,\nChief of Naval Staff. The president,\nthe admiral and the top brass visit in all their finery, but in reality,\non ships out at sea, the people below or even on deck\nare often wreathed in smoke and caked in soot,\noil and diesel. It's like: \"Let's do this one up\nso people can see we're investing\", but none of it's really real. We're preparing for\ndefence combat missions. Romania's bought F-16s, Patriots,\nradar systems. They're okay. And MRAPs. The 5.56 NATO calibre has been adopted,\nthe police use 9 mm, but we still have Carpați pistols. You use the pistol\nbecause it's all you've got. The newest pistol I saw was from 1976. My colleagues had it,\nmine was a '72. I saw it fall apart in their hands.\nIt disintegrated when they fired it. Mine didn't fall apart,\nbut it jammed. I had to use brute force to unjam it. As an officer, you can't defend\na unit or ship with that pistol. It belongs in a museum.\nAnd it's standard issue. Only the Special Forces\nhave proper weapons. When I see officers with Carpați pistols or NCOs with the old Kalashnikovs,\nwith wooden, not folding, stocks, it doesn't make me think of a NATO army. Let's clean our weapons... Phones down,\nwar and the Russians are coming! The weaponry's outdated.\nMy first gun was from '75. The supreme commander is shown\nthe Mountain Huntsmen's weaponry. The first time I used it, it fell to bits\nwhen I fired the second magazine. The receiver cover flew off, I couldn't find the trigger,\nthe screws came out. The weapons kept failing. Some could never be fired at a target,\nno amount of adjusting helped. The same problem with ancient ammo.\nTons of misfires... Loads of bullets\ngetting stuck in the barrel. You just hoped it wouldn't misfire! Fire! - Misfire!\n- Damn! - Misfire!\n- Misfire! - Incident!\n- Get away from the mortar! The mortars were old, too.\nSome had cracks in them. Older colleagues said that often,\nwhen they fired, the bombs were so old\nthat when they left the barrel, the grass in front was burning. They looked down and a bit of the bomb\nwas lying in front of the mortar. You'd be shaking\nbecause mortars often blew up. Our weapons were just for show.\nAll we had was what you saw. You could move them left and right\nor up and down, but maybe not fire them with ammo,\nwhich didn't exist. I was in charge of some \"munitions\"\ncompartments, they were empty. Or there was other stuff in them,\nbut you had to know they were for ammo. I asked why there was none.\n\"Just because.\" It bothered me,\nbut the others were used to it. We took part in a medical exercise\ninvolving 19 countries. To learn about other people's methods,\nkit and training. They had inflatable, insulated tents\nwith warmth, comfort... And we were in\nthis big old tent, 5 x 60, with a stove and firewood beside it... We felt lousy. I went to Ukraine for a NATO event. A colleague and I\ngot to visit an American ship. We set off, and when the ships\ngathered on the Black Sea, we could see smoke\nbillowing out of one in the distance. Some people beside us\non the bridge asked, in English, \"Whose is that ship?\nIs it on fire? Should we rescue them?\" When we got closer,\nit was our Romanian ship! It was smoking so much,\nthe Americans thought they needed saving! They asked us\nwhat had happened to our ship. We said it was old\nand had an old engine. We didn't know how to explain\nthe woeful state we were in. Everything's been achieved:\ninfrastructure, equipment and staffing. And I must say that the progress\nis considerable and sustainable. We have far superior equipment and our military personnel\nare increasingly well trained. TRAINING There are three periods\nof firing exercises. Daytime firing, night firing, firing with the sub-unit,\nthe company, and so on. Two or three times a year. Depending on the unit you're in. Throughout the system,\nwhichever branch you're in, the level of training should be\nthe same across the board. No, I didn't shoot enough.\nJust once or twice a year. Short bursts, fire! There's not enough time\nto master it and really learn. The Land Forces may shoot better,\nbut not getting much practice isn't unusual. In the last two years... I haven't fired in two, three,\nfour, five years, I think. That's what a soldier should do. Gun in hand,\nat the range. I'm an operational officer\nand I don't do it. That's shameful,\nbut I find that asking upsets them. Some people did no shooting.\nIt was very rare. We asked if we could work out in the gym,\nbut they never let us. \"There's work to do...\" \"Carry that sand!\"\n\"Load bricks onto a lorry!\" \"Cut the grass!\"\n\"Do this, do that...\" Once, we were leaving\nthe unit with our kit and someone very senior in the unit\nasked us what we were doing. \"We're going to do some training.\" \"Forget that,\nyou need to shift this hay.\" We should have been able to swim,\nshoot, run miles, lob grenades... There was none of that.\nNo sport or even swimming. A lot of my fellow sailors couldn't swim. The bosses gave\na fascinating explanation when I asked: \"If you don't teach us how to swim, how can we work in the Navy?\" They said someone who couldn't swim focused on saving the ship. That training isn't daily\nas we have other duties. We call ourselves \"cleaning ladies\". We were like farmers. My hands were always green\nfrom clearing grass between slabs. And I'd dreamed of doing\nlots of things... Winter was interesting. Our morning physical training\nwas clearing snow. Then you went into a field\nor hid from the bosses and chatted. Or they read a book out to you when\nwhat you needed was to practise and learn, not have obsolete rules\nread out to you. We did two big exercises a year. You had to do tactics beforehand. To do tactics properly,\nyou need training ammo, which we never had. Instead, our superiors told us\nto shout \"bang, bang\". \"Shout 'bang, bang' how?\"\n\"As if you're shooting!\" We couldn’t believe our ears. \"Shout 'bang, bang' realistically,\nso we can hear. Or otherwise, dry fire your guns.\nGo on, shout 'bang, bang'!\" We didn't know what else to do. How do people keep their skills sharp\nif they don't shoot? They don't. That's the reality.\nOn paper, it's a different story. The result's \"fit\" or \"unfit\",\nbut it makes no difference. I did annual exercises where\nonly the date changed from year to year. Imagine that! For three years running,\nonly the date changed, in reality. The exercises had to look good. The officials had to be wowed with smoke,\nexplosions and soldiers crossing trenches which they'd actually slept in\nthe night before. The records said:\n\"The platoon marched 20 km.\" In fact, it was brought by truck\nand walked 1 km. The focus has been different\nin the past three years. But things stayed the same\nfor years on end. That's how we trained.\nAre we combat-ready? ABUSE Most of those who leave\ndon't leave for higher pay. Most don't know where they'll go\nor what they'll earn, they get fed up of being humiliated and not being paid for time worked. I think the main reason\nis the bosses' behaviour. People came and just yelled at you. We were practising gun salutes\nfor an NCO who'd just died. We sang the anthem,\nthen we had to load and fire. We saw the chaplain\nholding a pool cue. He started whacking us all from behind.\nI think there were six of us. He said:\n\"Are you men? Can't you sing?\" We stared at each other in shock. There was a lieutenant colonel there,\nhe laughed. Humiliated. This happened in front of a senior officer,\nand he laughed instead of helping. Normally, a military prosecutor\nshould investigate. Some priests from Bucharest\nwho were generals came and said:\n\"It's Easter, it's best to forgive, the chaplain has a problem...\" Nothing came of it.\nThe whole thing was buried in a week. People joked about the chaplain\nhitting us with his cue. Or you'd see him at the unit, say hello,\nand he'd raise his middle finger. There are commanders and chiefs\nwho sometimes seem to think they're not running an organisation,\nthey're lords of the manor. If they ignore subordinates, are arrogant\nor only listen to a couple of people, the unit will be run\nlike in Ceaușescu's day. I started to have second thoughts\nabout being in the Army on 15 October 2021,\na Monday. I went to the deputy commander,\nwho was in charge as the commander wasn't there that day. I asked for extra hands\nto unload a truck from Bistrița with renovation and building materials\nlike cement and finishing plaster. He looked at me and said: \"Get out, you filthy scum!\nF*** the filthy lot of you! Go and unload it yourself\nwith your filthy lot!\" He didn't let me speak,\nhe threw me out. I went and unloaded the truck\nwith two other people. If you did nothing wrong,\nyou'd still be sworn at, thrown out, then he'd come\ninto the hall and joke with you. Two minutes later,\nmore swearing. I'll give you a real-life example. A young lieutenant in our unit was insulted\nby the colonel in charge of the section. He reported the colonel,\nbut the unit commander didn't support the lieutenant\nand told him off. The lieutenant sent\na report to Bucharest. The reply said\nhis boss should deal with it. After that, the lieutenant resigned\nand got a job at a very good company in his field, where he was earning\nalmost double a year later. I was treated like dirt. If I'd worked for the waste collection firm,\nI'd have been much more respected. I was sworn at, humiliated,\nthrown out and treated unfairly. PAY With war at its border, Romania is launching\nits biggest recruitment drive for soldiers with starting wages of RON 2,000-4,000. Although the government recently hiked pay,\npeople in the system seem dissatisfied. Many break the rules\nby seeking other sources of income. At least 5-10 people in every unit\ndo food delivery, even officers. Officers and NCOs alike do all sorts.\nMany work as waiters. Delivery, odd jobs like day labouring...\nI do ridesharing. I had to do my best to hide the fact\nthat I was in the military. The rules make it clear we can't do things\nthat could affect our status. People ask: \"Don't you earn much?\nWhy are you doing this?\" It's not how it looks on TV. Living standards are falling,\nprices are rising, but pay is static\nor creeping up slowly. I met a Bolt driver and asked what he earned.\nHe said it was a side job. I asked what his main job was,\nexpecting him to say taxi driving. He said: \"I'm a captain.\"\nI was gobsmacked! I'm ashamed to admit it,\nbut I couldn't make ends meet despite not having a mortgage\nor anything else to pay off. I decided to moonlight. I got into insurance\nand then ridesharing. It wasn't enough. From month to month... I often asked my parents\nto bung me RON 100 to tide me over. Most of them did other jobs\nin their free time or while on leave. Many took leave and worked abroad\neven though that was banned. Everyone looks for an alternative,\nbecause a sergeant who's fresh out of school\nstarts on RON 3,500-3,600 a month. A lieutenant gets about RON 4,500,\nup to RON 4,600. The public get wind of a few excesses and assume the salaries are sky-high. I've given you my payslip\nshowing that an NCO made RON 2,335 a month when I left,\nplus the food allowance. If I was sent on an exercise,\nthat allowance was cut because they laid on food. I'll dig out a payslip so you can see what an officer makes after 20 years. November 2022\nRON 5,358 People hear about huge salaries on telly. Yes! There ARE some big earners! They work in the Army\nfor the judiciary, for example. Law graduates who,\nwithin six months of joining the Army, become prosecutors or land other jobs\nwith big salaries, premiums, the works. Soldiers aren't so badly off\nthey can't eat, but they can't afford\na meal out with good wine. It's not just about money,\nyou also need to feel a sense of community,\nlike you're part of something bigger than you. THE WAR A lot of people are quitting because of\nthe war, it's another reason to go. Because they realise they wouldn't survive\nin the current situation. We'd be vulnerable.\nCaught with our pants down. It's a big problem because,\nwith our weaponry, if there were a conflict now, we could only\ndeploy units like the Special Ops Forces. We wouldn't send all the unequipped units\nand all the troops. The war in Ukraine is tough,\nbut it's nothing to be scared of. We're soldiers,\nwe swore an oath we believe in, and we'll do our duty\nif need be. Most of us who stay are kept going\nby hope that things will change. We really believe in our oath. A lot of people like me\nbelieve in it, but... ...we're only human. I swear! - Allegiance to Romania.\n- Allegiance to Romania. - I swear!\n- I swear! I stayed for six years. I'd hoped to progress,\nbut there was only so much I could take. No one thanks you\nor appreciates what you do. I was discouraged.\nI couldn't see a future, and I still can't. I don't think I'll ever re-enlist. The day I resigned, I told an officer\nI was on good terms with. There was a camp coming up.\nI said: \"Sir, I want to tell you something. I won't be at the camp,\nI'm resigning.\" \"Where are you going?\"\n\"England.\" \"Good for you.\" A lot of the older ones said:\n\"I'd do the same if I were your age.\" After leaving,\nwe came to the UK. We decided to make a fresh start\nin Leicester, in the Midlands. A nice, quiet little town. Here's where we work.\nBoden. - Here?\n- Yes. A clothing warehouse. It's not tough. You get used to it\nafter a bit. I've got no regrets. Because this is what we expected:\nto leave work and forget about it till tomorrow. On 26 October, I decided to leave.\nA day I'll never forget. I said I just couldn't go on.\nI put in my notice. The frustration had built up because you had to obey their orders\nno matter what. And they often did things\nthey shouldn't have. The training did us good, we learned a lot\nand it boosted our team spirit. It was very beneficial. The problem came\nwhen we got out there and saw the real Army. I now work for a firm in Timișoara. No more stress.\nNo one swearing at me. No... No put-downs.\nWe all get along very well. I regret staying as long as I did. I regret having to pay\nRON 9,800 for the training. But even if it was RON 200 million\nor RON 20,000, it wouldn't matter. Money's not the reason\nwhy I joined, left or stayed. Like I said,\nit was their behaviour. How did I resign? I stayed in Mangalia\nin August and September. I'd sat tests for the academy.\nI got into the academy. I proved to myself\nI was strong and resilient. But I questioned whether I wanted\nto end up like some military bigwig. Did I want to be like an admiral? Was that what I wanted?\nNo, it wasn't. To get there,\nyou have to step over dead bodies and suppress your morals and feelings. Now I'm a trainer\nat an investment consultancy firm that provides financial education. I feel extremely relaxed and calm. I'm not stressed, but I AM working.\nI didn't quit so someone could support me. I work in a different community of people\nwho are open and not ruled by fear. These parading soldiers\nhave gone on overseas missions... - Did you parade on 1 December?\n- Yes, in Arad. The only time I felt proud. For all of two and a half minutes. The only minutes in two and a half years\nwhen I was proud to be a soldier. It's about something that's not real. They spray diesel and cola\non the APCs and tanks so they shine on 1 December. But almost all the brakes on them\nhave had it. They clap and throw flowers at you.\nIt's nice. But then you think: \"What were they doing?\nWho or what were they applauding?\" The military is a compact system in which soldiers are gagged. We often hear:\n\"You're not allowed to think!\" We're to blame too,\nto an extent. We don't tell it like it is. Things are misrepresented. The problem's getting bigger. We try to cover things up\ninstead of facing them. Eight servicemen died\nin a bizarre air disaster... Since the MiG and the copter crashed\nlast year in March, we've seen no reform. We just got an email\nthat forced us to sign something saying we couldn't disclose\nconfidential information. It's frustrating. I think what the Army lacks\nmost of all is vision. I'm experienced, but I'm sad that\nno one's thinking of the youngsters. Do we stick to our vision? I think it's behind the times.\nTimes have changed. I still feel pride, I'm a patriot\nand I do respect my country, but I don't respect corruption or people who don't think\ntheir orders or words through. I can't just say:\n\"Yes, I respect what you say.\" That's what they need:\nan update, a bit of a change. Forward march! In recent months, the Army ran a campaign\nto recruit over 4,000 professional soldiers. ♪ Hope dies last\nThat we will be ♪ ♪ Hope dies last\nThat we will live ♪ ♪ Look at the blue sky... ♪ Recorder requested interviews on camera\nwith defence secretary Angel Tîlvăr and General Daniel Petrescu,\nChief of the Defence Staff.

I was at middle school. My sister was at his school, he was friends\nwith my parents and taught my sister. He seemed very nice. My sister and her classmates said\nhe was great about marks and absences. Funny, nice.\nNo one had a bad word to say about him. Cătălina (name changed) started Year 9\nat the theological school in 2021 aged 15. Her parents were working abroad. Farcaș, her teacher,\nkept them posted on her progress. Knowing her family situation,\nhe often offered the 15-year-old lifts. One day,\nhe gave me a lift home and said: \"Let's be friends,\nnot teacher and pupil. Stop calling me 'Sir'.” I kept saying it out of respect,\nit felt overfamiliar not to. But he kept correcting me\nand I agreed to be friends. - I said happy birthday Sir\n- Sir? Who's that? - You\n- Not Sir then Sorry, habit [Messages shown with Cătălina's permission] Did he stay friends with your parents,\nwho were away? Yes, he told them\nall was well. They often talked\nabout my school situation. He never let on I was bunking off\nand getting low marks. He covered for me\nbecause he was supposedly my friend. - But he should have been something else.\n- Yes. He was acting like a friend,\nnot a teacher. Could you get me out of\nNew Testament too? Yes Without marking me absent Hmmmm What'll happen then? If I said I couldn't go in or would be late,\nhe said \"Okay\" or \"I'll excuse you\". I saw being friends\nas a good thing. - How many lessons did you miss today?\n- Why? - Just curious\n- Do you wanna tell Mum? Or... Don't think that about me. At first, he let me do\nas I liked at school, and we were friends after school too,\nhe invited me for coffees by text. I thought we really were friends,\nlike he'd suggested. I nearly came to trust him. - Compensatory coffee tomorrow?\n- Sure - Shall I ring you when I wake up or will you ring me?\n- Noooo, not that early - Get some sleep\n- Already in bed But go to sleep Nighty-byes Take care He started paying me compliments and inviting me for drives,\nhe was a driving instructor. All sorts. - Come with me tomorrow?\n- Where - For a drive\n- Maybe Ok Starting at 10.\nIf you want... Kisses Kisses (only cuz you're\nfriends with my sis) As long as we're kissing If I didn't reply to his messages,\nhe'd text me to ask why. Or he'd say I took him for granted,\nunderestimated him, or I should trust him more. Messages that aren't natural\nbetween a teacher and a pupil. I care. If I didn't, I'd hurt somewhere.\nYou don't get that. Know what hurts? Wanting the best\nfor someone who doesn't give a...??? This resistance\nmakes it impossible. One day, you'll realise I saw the real you\nPromise And you'll realise\nthat was cuz I let you No\nYou've hardly let me do anything Yes I have Almost nothing A little :) :) We chatted daily till one, two,\nvery late. I felt bad, but I replied. I think it was\nmanipulation, it must've been. I wouldn't go along with it\never again. Closing up... Gets you nowhere\nOpen up Cătă You could help me\nwith school etc but if we argue,\nyou could use stuff I reveal against me What I discuss with people stays private.\nI help if I can. I stay out if not. I'm not a traitor.\nI know how betrayal feels. I don't get this open with everyone\nMaybe you'll get to know me better In class, I called him \"Sir\",\nit was a pupil-teacher relationship. But in messages,\nhe said stuff he'd never say openly. Did they make you feel\nhe wanted more than friendship? Yes. They weren't the kind of messages\nyou'd send a friend. Compliments, invitations to town,\nit was way OTT. - What did you do in the gym today? Legs?\n- Yes - They'll hurt tomorrow\n- Oh noooo - But who has great legs now...\n- Only the trainer Meaning you don't\nDon't say that If he didn't invite me\nto town or for a drive, I'd see him at school, or he'd drive\nme home or pick me up in the morning. Have a great day Kisses for you,\ndear girl I've got a burial at 1 pm, see you after?\nOr later? Nighty-byes Sweet dreams Hugs and kisses! Kisses He took me to watch\nthe boys' ministry classes. He'd make them do squats and press-ups.\nHe filmed them. To humiliate them, since they talked to our class,\nto show us they were dumb for obeying. And to show us his influence. Silvia Ciubotaru-Guță is a psychologist\nwho runs \"In a Relationship\", a project that tackles\nteen-on-teen abuse. Power dynamics come into play here.\nA teacher has power over a pupil. A teacher is a figure of authority. If he's also a priest,\nhe has not just a teacher's authority, but also religious authority\nas a man of God. There were also\nthose departures from the rules: excusing absences,\nhiding things from pupils' families. The aim is to make minors\ntrust the teacher more and feel indebted to him\nat the same time. The boundaries are very blurred. The messages I've seen\nshow a kind of pressure, manipulation. She's specifically asked to open up,\ntrust him more. The official term is \"grooming\". It means preparing victims gradually so they don't identify the abuse. Step by step,\nthe abuser gains victims' trust until his authority makes them\nmistrust their own judgment, feelings and perception\nof what's going on. Even if it didn't go beyond\nwhat I've seen here, this is unquestionably\na form of abuse. Farcaș is an archdeacon\nas well as a teacher. Videos show him officiating at services\nwith Bishop Iustin of Maramureș and Sătmar. Baia Mare Episcopal Cathedral ♪ Redeem us, ♪ ♪ son of God. ♪ ♪ Forget not to do good ♪ ♪ and give succour unto others! ♪ Two months into the school year,\nFarcaș and his class decided to go on a trip. In November, we decided\nto go on a school trip out of town to get together\nand have fun. He gave us consent forms\nfor our parents to sign. 17 pupils, all minors,\nsigned up for the trip. We paid and he went shopping\nwith some of the girls. He worked out how much they'd drink.\nBeing girls, they couldn't have much. And he got cigarettes\nfor whoever wanted them. A few crates of booze:\nStrongbow, beer, vodka, Jäger... \"We can get more from town\nif we run out.\" THE TRIP Let it stay forever! On the Saturday morning,\nhe gave them pălincă. Amen! Profile pic! He drew soot crosses on their foreheads\nand gave them pălincă to drink. For fun, fooling around, I dunno.\nThat's blasphemy, how could he? Were any other adults there? Răzvan, who owned the cabin,\nFarcaș's friend. You girls are all mine!\nFilm this! No bubbles! Happy days! The teacher and Răzvan\nare drinking! LATER 22... You don't know\nhow many there are in Revelation? 111,\nI'll help you. 2 Corinthians! Jude, John, John. Who is it?\nI don't care. Evening! Towards the evening,\nthere was table dancing, things degenerated. ♪ The Gospel, yes, the Gospel,\nThe Gospel has power! ♪ ♪ The Gospel, yes, the Gospel,\nThe Gospel has power! ♪ Everyone knows! Thanks for the applause! A FEW HOURS LATER ♪ Without a care, let's make noise\nSo people know who we are! ♪ ♪ Up on the tables,\nWithout a care, ♪ ♪ Let's make noise\nSo people know who we are! ♪ ♪ It's full of joy,\neuros, dollars and pounds. ♪ ♪ Joy, joy,\nYou're with me wherever I go. ♪ ♪ My pocket speaks\nany language it wants, ♪ ♪ English and French... ♪ Many of the videos\nmade during the trip were made by the teacher,\nDaniel Farcaș, himself. The images show that\nFarcaș set no limits on drinking. By morning, some girls\nwere in a life-endangering state. I've banged myself! If you're a minor\nand you're not used to drinking, and you're with two men, when there's been boozing,\nyou can't read the mind of an adult who's with girls, minors,\nwho are under the influence. The booze, smoking, atmosphere,\nthe owner of the cabin... None of it was okay. After the party, Farcaș went up\nto one of the girls' bedrooms. What's more troubling\nthan the images of the party room, with music and dancing,\nis the images of the girls' bedrooms with the class teacher, the priest,\nlying on the bed and the girls around him\nbeing photographed like that. THE NEXT DAY He woke us on the Sunday so we could\nclear up and leave in the morning. Some of them felt sick. In group chats,\nthey said \"It was cool\", \"I can't remember\", \"I can't get up\",\n\"I feel so sick\". - What was the group name?\n- Fozy and The Harem. What's Fozy? Dunno, that was his nickname\nfor generations. The group name is chilling. A harem was a group of women\nwho served, usually with sexual services, a man in a position\nof great power. Joking about that, likening a class of girls\nat a theological school to a harem, is seriously wrong in itself. ♪ Lord, redeem believers. ♪ Hello? - Hello. Daniel Farcaș?\n- Hello, yes? - I'm Isabela Pop, a journalist at Recorder.\n- Hello. We're going to publish an item about a case\ninvolving you and we need your view. Right. First, the trip you took in November 2021\nwith your class of girls. Images show you giving minors alcohol\nand being in bed with them. If you look more closely, you'll see almost the whole class went\non that trip and we were telling stories. I don't think you've ever\ngone away somewhere and just sat on chairs\nwithout telling stories or chatting. Did you pour shots\ndown their throats? No, it was a game\nand there was no alcohol in the glasses. Did you film girls who were\ninebriated and table dancing? Videos were made by them, I'm not in the habit of making videos\nas I go around, sorry. We have videos of you filming them dancing,\nfilming them inappropriately, let's say. - For a teacher, at least.\n- \"Inappropriately\" how? They were inebriated\nand dancing, and you were holding your phone camera\nnear their bottoms. Interesting way of looking at it. I'd like to see these images\nwhich you say show me standing close to certain parts\nof the girls and filming them improperly,\nor whatever you said. I don't think I'm that... obsessed a person,\nin inverted commas, sorry. The trip was organised\nby the parents, it was during the holidays,\nand there was no alcohol in those glasses, it was just a game. Cheers, girls!\nDon't pull faces! Bravo! - For good luck!\n- Cameras off! - You're blushing, teacher!\n- The filming's continuing! Come here! Parents went on the trip too. We've obtained about\n100 images and videos. No adults other than you\nand the cabin owner appear in them. You're saying\nparents organised the trip? Exactly. - Can you send me photos with parents in?\n- Certainly. We have chats and messages you sent\nto a former Year 9 pupil. You complimented her,\nsaid she had great legs and invited her for drives and coffees,\ndo you think that's appropriate? I'm not aware\nof any such messages, and you know lots of photos\nand messages can be faked. Your class's group was called\n\"Fozy and The Harem\". Yes, that's been a nickname of mine\nfor many years... I didn't choose the group name,\nI wasn't in charge of it. - Do you know what a harem is?\n- Of course. Why did you join\na group called that? You know what young people are like\nand the sorts of things they say, those... ...aged 16-17\nor even younger. And I don't think a group name\ninfluences what's said within the group. You agreed to join it? Of course,\nbecause I was the teacher, Madam. Okay. It's 11:20, can you send us images\nand videos of parents on the trip by 1:30? - Certainly.\n- Okay. Now listen to me a moment. If your item is damaging to me and the evidence...\nthe ideas you publish are untrue, I reserve the right to sue you. As Farcaș didn't send us any proof\nor answer further calls, we tried again. Hello,\nsorry I didn't answer. - Can you talk now?\n- Yes. When you phoned me at midday... He said a family member\nhad suddenly fallen seriously ill. I keep going to the GP\nfor prescriptions, medicines and so on. I'll happily listen now. We talked about the proof\nyou were going to send us. Like I said,\nI'm still out. It's not out of bad faith that I'm not\nsending you the pictures, God forbid. I want all this to be cleared up too,\nas I said, absolutely, once and for all. You said earlier that there was water,\nnot alcohol, in the girls' glasses. Right. I can definitely assure you\nno alcohol was served while I was there,\nby me at least. I say that most sincerely. If none was drunk,\nhow did the girls get into that state? I can't say. While I was there, at least,\nno alcohol was drunk, I guarantee it. Okay. - I've been teetotal for at least eight years.\n- Okay. I'd be very curious indeed\nto see these images and videos. I haven't served alcohol\nfor eight years. Who is it?\nI don't care. INJUSTICE He was too full on, all the invitations to town\nwere making me uncomfortable. He was really in my face,\nit wound me up. I said I wanted to go back\nto being pupil and teacher. She says her teacher's attitude\nthen changed radically. He'd have a go at me\nover the tiniest thing. He cut me off on Meet,\nhe threw me out of class when he started talking to me\nand I answered. \"Take your bag and get out!\"\nOkay... I wanted to go and he took my bag\nwith my phone in it out of my hand. I spoke to him informally in the classroom.\nHe said: \"How dare you?\" \"We're friends,\nwhy not?\" \"No, we're not.\" \"What?\" He stood up, threw the register\nand stuff at me, and said I was rude. We argued, things degenerated,\nand he stood in the doorway. I said I'd ring my parents\nif he trapped me. He snatched my phone off me. I got scared,\nI wanted to open the door behind him. He grabbed me\nand pushed me. I started to cry\nand managed to get out. Teachers heard the noise\nand came into the corridor. He started telling me off so they'd think\nhe'd thrown me out for being rude. He said he'd put in a request\nto expel me. - Did anyone defend you?\n- No. When he asked the class, they took his side\nand denied they'd seen anything. Did Farcaș push me into the wall\nin class today? I didn't see cuz\nI put my hands over my face Why? I was nervous\nAnd I kept them there for a few mins But did you hear me\nfall on the chairs Didn't notice Pff What on earth did he say\nto get you all to clam up... I've got nothing to say I don't know for sure\nI stopped looking Right I know this is tough for you\nBut I didn't see him push you Did Farcaș hit me in class today?\nDid he push me into the wall? Like XXX said, I wasn't looking,\nI only heard It's a kind of solidarity that results\nfrom manipulation, deception. Victim blaming is very much\na feature of these situations. Victims are harassed and overwhelmed by the fact\nthat no one seems to believe them or creates the space necessary\nfor an investigation. Until the truth comes out, the victim is traumatised and retraumatised\nby all the abuser's supporters. A day after the physical assault, the pupil\ndecided to report the abusive behaviour. I went and told the headmaster\nwhat had happened. I took a CD with photos and videos\nof the cabin and chats including his invitations to town,\ncompliments and advances. He didn't seem very surprised, he said he didn't know which cabin I meant\nand it was good I'd come to him. What did he say about\nyour class teacher pushing you? The camera was off,\nit didn't film the quarrel. I asked a priest, the headmaster, for help\nand instead of supporting me, he said that. We asked the headmaster\nfor his view of the incident and the images\nprovided by the pupil. My understanding is that\nthe girl wanted to go out and the teacher\nstood in the doorway. The cameras\ndidn't pick anything up. The pupils in the class\nsay there was no shoving. Okay. You've received videos and photos\nshowing the teacher, Daniel Farcaș, in inappropriate situations,\nto say the least. That get-together\nwas during the holidays, the approval of the school\nand the inspectorate wasn't sought. It was organised\nby some parents and the pupils, and I understand Mr Daniel Farcaș\nwas asked to go too. It's the girl's word\nagainst the parents'. No, we have video evidence\nand images... The parents' representatives told me\nthey organised it and took part. Okay. Now that you've received this information\nand evidence showing Daniel Farcaș in bed surrounded by girls,\ngiving them alcohol, table dancing... Yes. ...do you think\nthat behaviour's okay for a teacher of morality\nand the New and Old Testaments? At our school,\nit's not okay. He definitely went too far. Based on what we saw, a school board met\nand took decisions against the teacher to stop him teaching morality\nand remove him as class teacher. We imposed these penalties. He was highly regarded until then. That's the toughest possible penalty\nshort of dismissal. We've also received chats in which\nmessages sent by Daniel Farcaș are, to say the least, inappropriate\nbetween a teacher and a pupil. He said:\n\"Who has great legs?\", \"Kisses\", \"I don't care about the others,\nI'd talk to them if I did\", \"Sweet dreams\",\n\"Nighty-byes\". He sent them at midnight\nto a 15-year-old. Okay. We saw, we punished,\nwe took action. Again, bearing in mind there'd been\nno previous misconduct in 20 years... After this action, Farcaș continued to teach\nthe New and Old Testaments at the school. Cătălina's classmates protested over\nhis removal from their class. 11 FEBRUARY 2022 - Why did they protest?\n- To support him, against me. The children and their parents\nsaid I'd faked the photos and chats. I had nothing to offer them,\nhe could excuse absences and give high marks. Of course he had\nmuch more influence. To calm things down,\nthe school's management moved Cătălina to the boys-only ministry class. FEB 2022 MAY 2022 As a parent of XXX, I requested\na meeting (...) about Mr Daniel Farcaș... As Farcaș continued to teach at the school,\nthe pupil's mother took the matter up with the Bishop of Maramureș and Sătmar,\nthe most senior local prelate. BISHOP\nI'm glad you told me all this! I've long suspected something's not right\nabout Daniel Farcaș. So I've sent him to another church,\nnot the cathedral! I'm in the USA for 2 more weeks!\nThen I'll investigate and we'll act as necessary! Rest assured\nI don't tolerate things like this! In the summer of 2022, Farcaș was stopped\nfrom serving as a clergyman. But he kept teaching, including morality,\nthe following school year. The Church clearly feels\nDaniel Farcaș can't serve as his behaviour wasn't moral or ethical,\nyet he's suitable for the school? - He's fit and proper to teach?\n- In professional terms, he's a very well-trained teacher. He achieved notable results in Olympiads\nwith pupils at national level. He went astray,\nstepped out of line. He's making amends. Penalties were imposed. Taking him off clerical duties\nhas consequences because he can't wear\na cassock in school now. Penalties were imposed. Daniel Farcaș says the penalties\nare temporary and were imposed following negotiation with the diocese\nto avert a media scandal. I decided together with\nBishop Iustin that I'd stop serving,\nbut I haven't been kicked out of the Church. He said it was best if I stepped back\nfrom the clergy for a time by not serving, and we should let things take their course\nuntil this blows over. Just between us,\nthe diocese is terrified of the media and being cast in a bad light\nin any situation, not necessarily mine. So this is to shut the media up\nso you can come back? Exactly. The decision was taken by agreement\nbetween me and Bishop Iustin. I'll resume my duties in a few months\nif that's deemed appropriate. The Diocese of Maramureș and Sătmar\ntold Recorder that Farcaș had been relieved\nof clerical duties due to his divorce, not anything he had done\nas a teacher. \"...he cannot serve (…) as he\nhas broken canon law as a divorced cleric.\" The diocese confirmed Farcaș\nhad been reported to it over his attitude and said two pupils, not one,\nhad complained about him. \"...two pupils (...) reported inappropriate\nconduct by teacher Daniel Farcaș.\" At the end of Year 9,\nCătălina changed school. Farcaș still teaches pupils\nat the theological school, including the class\nhe went on the trip with. \"He is pursuing\nhis teaching activity responsibly.\" REPORTERS\nIsabela Pop & Alina Păduraru EDITORS\nMihai Voinea & Cristian Delcea CAMERA\nDavid Muntean & Adrian Gherghel MUSIC\nEmanuel Abrudean & Epidemic Sound ENGLISH SUBTITLES\nPeter Shortall & Florin Ular"}

All Europe is disputing Austria's \"no\" vote\nwhich keeps Romania out of Schengen. Breaking news:\nAustria's chancellor and interior minister say their country's standing firm. Late last year, Romania was kept out\nof the Schengen Area again, so checks at its borders\nwith its EU neighbours are continuing. The decision triggered\nan unprecedented public backlash and politicians felt duty-bound\nto echo the outrage. Good evening.\nAs prime minister and a citizen of Romania, I’d firstly like to express my deep\ndisappointment at the lack of consensus within the JHA Council today\nover Romania’s entry to the Schengen Area. Today, they voted completely unfairly\nagainst Romania and Romanians. But the populist rhetoric masked\na fact well known to border officials: not all politicians want Romania\nto join Schengen and drop border checks, as these checks bring in dirty money\nfor a pyramidal network that stretches from front-line officers\nall the way up to top politicians. There was delight over the fact\nthat we didn’t get into Schengen. The checkpoint system's political overlords and their parties would lose money. Our investigation began last year\nwhen sources at border points showed us evidence of corruption\nin a less well-known part of the system: the National Road Infrastructure\nAdministration Company (CNAIR), which manages the movement of HGVs\ninto and out of Romania. CNAIR officers at checkpoints\ncharge a levy for lorries based on their size,\nweight and, in some cases, age. A checkpoint officer sent us a video\nshowing that hauliers of all nationalities who go through Romanian border crossings\nknow the routine here. - What's this?\n- Five. - How much?\n- 500. EUR 500? What's going on? Give me that. - Are you registering us?\n- The passport! In this case, the officer at the CNAIR desk\nis interested in the passport, not the bribe inside it. That clearly baffles the haulier,\nwho doesn't know what he's done wrong. Come here!\nCome over here! Come over here to my colleague. We're not talking.\nFinished! Take your money from there!\nOff you go! Mate! Mate, how much is this? Hello! Why did you give me that? At another checkpoint,\nan employee secretly films another situation showing that drivers\nare used to our system of bribery. Now we’ll see EUR 500 being offered\nso EUR 1,000 of road tax doesn’t have to be paid\nfor a clapped-out truck. EUR 500 and no tax. - Have you got EUR 500?\n- Yes, EUR 500. Show me!\nGet out! He's got EUR 500... The bribery attempt takes place\nin a car park after the driver signalled his intention to pay a bribe\non reaching the CNAIR kiosk. ...two, three, four... ...five. - 500, no tax!\n- No tax. Ah... 500... - No tax!\n- Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh.\nNo tax. Once again, the driver is surprised\nby the Romanian officer's refusal, so he tries again. - Come on. 500...\n- 500, no! Tax, correct! Okay? Mixing languages,\nthe driver tries to explain that the officer’s colleagues\nwere more obliging. - 500 with another colleague?\n- Other colleague, yes. - When, when?\n- Yes. EUR 500. - Other colleague?\n- Other... - ...speak...\n- Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.\nAnd the colleague [said]: no tax, go? The Turkish trucker is trying to dodge\na EUR 1,000 levy on second-hand lorries transiting through Romania which were bought\ninside the EU to be registered outside it. According to information\nobtained by Recorder, this levy would earn the state\nabout EUR 1 million a year per crossing if the system worked properly. But official statistics show\nthat in recent years, each crossing took\njust a few thousand euros. We spent a few days watching\nwhat happened at border crossings so we could suss out\nhow the bribery system works. I've been sleep-deprived for two days. I’m living in this car,\nwhich I’ve rigged up specially so I can't be seen from the front. The windows are tinted. At Calafat, we saw many lorries\nwith temporary reg numbers bypassing the 10-kilometre-long queue and making a beeline for the kiosks,\nas if by prior arrangement. We followed one and saw that,\na few metres from the kiosks, it was escorted by a man who seemed\nto specialise in this operation. Unbelievable! Sitting astride his bike, he seems\nto wield great authority at Calafat. Under his guidance, the trucker breaks\nevery traffic rule in the book. The officers seem used to this\nand don't intervene. Having sorted the lorry out, the man races off\nin search of more customers. SECRET FILMING - If you've got a lorry, why not go to the front?\n- What? How can I? Can I?\nWill you help me move it? - Which one?\n- My lorry. - Is it big?\n- Yes... Average. - How many tons?\n- Over seven. - Where are you?\n- Will you help me cross the bridge? - I've been here for 40 years!\n- Yeah? I can speak every language. A few months later, we return to Calafat.\nOur man’s still there. He has a better bike\nand is still in the same day job. We learn his name's Bodo and his main\nline of business is ushering lorries. He couldn’t do this\nwithout the tacit consent of the officers, whom he seems to know well. Allowing lorries to queue-jump\nis another way of wangling bribes at Romanian border crossings,\nwhere waiting times can reach 20-30 hours. Last year, six Border Police officers\nat another crossing were arrested and charged with taking bribes\nfrom hauliers to let them queue-jump. In 2021, Borș Border Police officers demanded and received\nsums of between EUR 50 and 100 from drivers of goods vehicles to shorten their waiting times... At Giurgiu, we saw a similar scenario,\nthis time involving an oversized vehicle, except that at the back,\ninstead of a man on a bike, there was a Border Police officer\nwho saw nothing amiss. - Did you send him to the front?\n- No, I made room for cars. - He's going to the car park.\n- He went past everyone. - Why are you filming without my consent?\n- I'm a journalist. Why did you send him to the front? You'll have to talk to\na Border Police spokesperson, not me. - I freed up the traffic.\n- I see! It's busy.\nBut that's not how we do things. We stay on the tail of the vehicle\nup to the CNAIR checkpoint. Normally, vehicles like this\nmust be measured and taxed accordingly. But this vehicle goes past the checkpoint\nwithout being measured. We show the footage to a local officer\nwho confirms the rules were broken. This vehicle was here,\nwe filmed it right here. - Should it have been measured?\n- Absolutely. We should've seen an employee... The length, width and height\nautomatically must be measured. If he got through without it being measured,\ndoes that suggest a prior arrangement? Possibly. They confirmed what the haulier\nrequested in the permit. They didn't compare.\nThey okayed it. - They said \"fine\".\n- \"What you put is fine.\" - Which is completely illegal?\n- Right. There’s a duty to compare\nwhat the permit says with the actual size. - In reality.\n- Yes. How would they have measured it? With an approved tape measure\nand a telescopic pole for the height. Alex, people time it just right. My name’s Florin Rădoi, I’m 55, and for about 29 years,\nI've been a shift supervisor with the Giurgiu Control\nand Collection Agency (ACI). Among the sources inside the system\nwho helped us with our research, only Florin Rădoi felt brave enough\nto be identified. Why are you speaking out now? Because you're my only hope. - Hope of what?\n- That something'll be done. In two months’ time,\nI’ll have been in the system for 29 years, and it's likely I'll leave it,\nbut I want to go with my head held high. Rădoi has seen many infringements\nat the Giurgiu crossing in his time. One example,\nof which we obtained video evidence, happened last year at the crossing\nfrom Bulgaria to Romania. A cement mixer was weighed\nduring my shift at around 6:20-6:30 am. The cement mixer was oversized, so rearranging the load and reweighing\nwouldn't have changed that. It was the vehicle itself. After it's weighed, the driver's told\nhe must pay a levy of EUR 800. But he pays nothing,\ngoes to the car park, and waits for Florin Rădoi's shift to end. The next person decided\nit was about 3-4 tons lighter. About EUR 800 should have been paid... - Based on your assessment?\n- Yes. Once he'd reweighed it,\nhe decided only EUR 50 was owed. That's a standard charge. How could a vehicle have shed\n4,000 kg in just a few hours so that a much smaller levy was owed? Every lorry that enters Romania must drive\nonto a scale in front of the CNAIR kiosk. It weighs the vehicle in real time and is extremely accurate as long as\nthe vehicle stays between the markers. If they're removed, the wheels on one side can be positioned\noff the scale, reducing the reading. In the CCTV footage, two men can be seen\nleaving the officers’ kiosk. One removes the marker\nto the right of the scale. The vehicle is then driven\nback onto the scale, and this time, it’s positioned\nas far to the right as possible. Our sources say this method of cheating\nthe scale with abnormal load vehicles is often used at all border crossings to take bribes from hauliers\nwho want to evade levies. Rădoi saw another such case last year, except that the lorry’s weight,\nand hence the levy owed, were much bigger. It was 30 metres long. I weighed it.\nIt weighed 106 tons. It had no police escort or special permit issued by the road administrator,\nwhich was us. Although the reading was over 100 tons,\nthe haulage firm had formally declared a weight of 55 tons in the documents –\nhalf the actual weight. Had the levy been based\non the declared weight, the firm would have owed EUR 1,500. But the levy for a 106-ton vehicle\nis EUR 30,000 due to the risk of major road damage. In a document obtained by Recorder,\nCNAIR confirms the incident at Giurgiu and mentions not only fraud against\nthe public purse and serious road damage, but also “major risks to the safety\nof other road users”. Yet the vehicle control officer\nwho noticed the exceedance wasn't rewarded. Instead, he was threatened\nand punished. The evening when I discovered\nthe abnormal load, they said the minister was being replaced,\nI was nobody. The next day, paradoxically, I was summoned\nto a meeting at the Giurgiu ACI. I turned up and was told\nI no longer had access to the lane and my duties would be curtailed. Later, I lost my shift supervisor status. The firm that owned\nthe illegal vehicle spotted by Rădoi, whose staff warned him he'd lose his job,\nwas Emy & Laura Spedition SRL. It’s one of Romania’s biggest haulage firms and is run by Emil and Laura Costinaș\nfrom Târgu Mureș, who flaunt their lavish lifestyle\non social media. Laura and Emy Costinaș!\nGood evening! - Good evening!\n- Good evening! Their firm is known to the top brass\nat CNAIR as a serial offender. CNAIR confirmed to Recorder that the firm has frequently committed fraud\nin recent years by declaring wrong destinations\nand unloading locations and using forged documents. But CNAIR can only detect irregularities\nat border crossings, not on roads or in haulage firms’ offices, which are monitored by another authority: the State Road Traffic Inspectorate (ISCTR). When it inspected Emy & Laura Spedition’s HQ\nat CNAIR’s behest, the ISCTR found no irregularities. As Emy & Laura Spedition is based in Mureș,\nwe went to the ISCTR office in that county to find out what checks\nit had carried out on the firm. The inspectorate’s office\nshould be here somewhere. Let’s see. This is the Traffic Inspectorate’s office,\nyou can see its inspection vehicles. But what’s surprising is that\nEmy & Laura Spedition is also based here. So the Inspectorate's renting premises\nin the building the firm's based in. The biggest haulage firm around here. You see?\nSo the policeman's a tenant of the potential thief\nhe has to check up on. The issue here is that my sources\nat border crossings say the firm’s staff use that fact to intimidate inspectors. They tell them\nthe inspectorate's under their thumb. And to back that up, they say\nthe ISCTR's staff are guests on their turf. Hello. I’m Alex Nedea,\na journalist from Recorder. I’d like to ask\nwhat checks you’ve carried out on the firm\nyou’re renting this office from. We have a press office,\nI can’t give any details. But how can an inspectorate\nthat’s supposed to check vehicles be based on premises\nowned by a haulage firm? Please speak to our head office,\nI can’t give any details. Uh-huh. - But do you inspect this firm?\n- Yes. Yes? You inspect your landlord? - No.\n- No? - No.\n- It's not your landlord? Emy & Laura’s employees had,\nand have, so much nerve that they'd say\nto control and collection officers: “Here's EUR 200, leave us be\nbecause the ISCTR's our tenant. No one can stop us,\nI only need to get past you.” If an inspector dared to ask more questions or ask for supporting documents\nfor a permit, they'd say: “We’ll kick you out,\nwe’re well connected. Watch what you ask for!” Representatives of Emy & Laura Spedition\nrefused to be interviewed but said all the offences detected\nwere accidents or their customers' fault. But haulage firms are just a brick\nin the pyramid of interest groups that control border crossings. Our sources say the bottom tier\nis corrupt control officers. They take bribes from hauliers\nwho pay them in order to dodge levies. Some of the money taken at checkpoints\nmoves up the pyramid to shift supervisors, county agency bosses\nand regional political leaders. In 2019, anti-corruption prosecutors\nraided the PSD’s Arad branch. Four of the party’s MPs were prosecuted for using their influence to hand out\nplum jobs in the border bribery system – control officer posts. No way! Did you intervene to put someone\nin a post or get them hired? No way! - Were jobs given by political command?\n- I don't know! Was money taken so lorries' weights\nwould be underdeclared? I don't believe that! - What do you know about bribes for heavier trucks?\n- Nothing! Prosecutors said Arad politicians\nstood to gain by giving trusted individuals seemingly unimportant control officer posts as they took bribes at crossings. What’s your status?\nSuspect? Mr Căprar, have you been made\na suspect in this case? The light's red,\nMr Căprar! Something fascinating happened\nafter the Arad probe: the state levies collected\nat the Nădlac checkpoint skyrocketed. For example, before the raids,\nthere were zero revenues from the levy on second-hand lorries\ntransiting through Romania. But afterwards,\nthe revenues shot up. Hello, Mr Căprar.\nI'm Alex Nedea, a journalist at Recorder. We’re making a documentary\nabout border crossing corruption, and you’re on trial for that. You know it’s not right or proper\nto talk about an ongoing criminal case. Tell me what you want me to clarify\nabout the case, and I'll tell you! Anything that doesn’t incriminate\nme or you. Well, what CAN you tell us? Firstly, I’m innocent! After that, it’s not up to me,\nit’s for the court to decide. How do you explain the fact that,\njust after the case began, the levy revenues\nat Nădlac Checkpoint 2 shot up? They simply skyrocketed. That's none of my business. Are you sure that's true?\nIt's none of my business. After this scandal,\nCăprar wasn’t put on the PSD’s lists for the 2020 parliamentary elections. But he did serve as an MP for eight years after driving lorries for four years\nat the start of his career. Road transport experience seems to be\na big asset for politicians in border counties. Another PSD MP from Arad,\nEusebiu-Manea Pistru, was a car mechanic\nand car salesman for 10 years and is now serving\na third term in Parliament. The same pattern can be seen in Giurgiu,\nanother key border county. Hello, everyone. Thank you very much\nfor coming to our press conference. As you know, the elections at the PSD’s\nGiurgiu County branch have been held. I’d like to thank everyone at this conference\nfor the trust they’ve placed in me… Marian Mina is a PSD MP and the chairman\nof the PSD’s county association. In the early 2000s,\nafter graduating in sport, he became a control officer\nat the Giurgiu crossing, where his main duty was collecting levies. I just heard what Mr Mina said. And I know he knows\na thing or two about taxes as he collected them at a barrier… I know a thing or two about everything. But this is an issue that the PNL... - I didn’t know that. Were you a levy collector?\n- No, never. - What are you?\n- He was a checkpoint officer… Forget it,\npeople are on a wild goose chase. His closeness to local PSD supremos\ncatapulted him to the helm of the Giurgiu ACI and later the Bucharest Regional Roads\nand Bridges Department (DRDP). In 2009, when Mina was head\nof the Giurgiu ACI, Adevărul reported that\ncontrol officers subordinate to him had been arrested for bribe-taking. It also alleged that some of the money\nhad gone to Mina. The arrested control officers\nincluded one Dana Costea. She and her husband\nare both still in that job 13 years later. Their wages have been close\nto the national minimum all this time, but colleagues say their standard of living\nexceeds their official salaries by far. They live in one of the biggest\nluxury houses in central Giurgiu. It’s so big that the couple\ncouldn’t even heat all of it on their salaries. We wanted to ask them\nhow they made their earnings stretch so far. We met Dana Costea\non her way home from work as she was parking up outside her des res. Hello! - Mrs Costea?\n- Yes. I'm Alex Nedea,\na journalist from Recorder. We’d like to ask: you're a border vehicle\ncontrol officer on a modest salary, so how could you afford this big house? - It's not mine!\n- Whose is it? Someone else's. Even the car looks pretty... ...pricey! She's forgotten where she lives. The post that the Costeas hold\nis one of the worst-paid jobs in the system, yet it’s also one of the most sought after. A control officer told us why. The wages are low on the basis that\n“You won't just earn your wages!” That was the slogan. So said the bosses\nwhen we asked for pay rises. Until recently, we earned even less than\na cleaner at a public institution, you know? The lure of this job is so great that\nit spurs some officers to take odd decisions. Recently, within the last month, I think, there was a legal advisor\nat the Giurgiu ACI’s HQ who was on about RON 6,500 a month,\nand he went down to RON 3,500 by becoming a control officer. He applied and sat an exam for that job! - Half his previous wage?\n- Yes. Why? Octavian Cătălinoiu is a member of the PSD and was a legal advisor\nat the Giurgiu ACI until recently. But he entered a competitive selection process\nfor a more junior and lower-paid job. He was hell-bent\non becoming a kiosk officer. - Hello, Mr Octavian Cătălinoiu?\n- Hello, yes. I'm Alex Nedea, a journalist at Recorder.\nI'd like to ask about your new job. You were a legal advisor\nat the Giurgiu ACI until a few months ago, on a reasonable salary. Why did you decide to become\na control officer and earn much less? I can't talk now, I'm a bit tied up,\nplease call back later. - Why can't you?\n- I'm busy. - Doing what?\n- I'm busy, thank you, bye! Without answers\nfrom those directly involved, we can only guess at why\njobs in kiosks are so coveted. We need only look into the past. Major fraud at the Giurgiu\nand Giurgeni bridge toll plazas! 13 officers are suspected of\ntaking money and forging receipts. They took as much as EUR 2,000 per shift and up to EUR 3 million\nwas stolen in a year. A bridge toll is charged\nat the Giurgiu checkpoint. The 2013 probe found that control officers\nhad pocketed lorry toll payments. According to the report, the theft was proved by the fact that\ndozens of lorry drivers filmed paying tolls didn’t appear in official records,\nmeaning the money had gone astray. Here’s how officers cheated the system. An employee stands in front of the cameras\nuntil the lorry drives off. The system doesn’t log the reg number,\nso the officers can secretly pocket the cash. Another tactic used by\nthe suspected fraudsters was getting drivers to keep their lorries\nwell away from the camera so the number plates couldn’t be seen and the money taken from drivers\ncould be kept by CNANDR employees. We wondered what had become of\nthe officers who got found out. - Most of them are still working.\n- In the same jobs? Some, yes. As control officers\nprotecting Romania’s road network. What do you think of that? I don't know...\nIt's unusual... Although the CNAIR review board recommended that all those implicated\nin the scandal be sacked, they were spared the axe by\nMarian Mina as head of the Bucharest DRDP. A report by the Ministry of Transport’s\ninternal review team said that in 2014, Mina had reinstated\nthe nine officers who'd been caught because their suspension\nhad hampered the authority’s operations. So Mina decided it would be\nbusiness as usual at the crossing, with those accused\nof being on the take staying put. The sway he already held was displayed\nnot only in decisions like that, but also in a lifestyle\nat odds with his asset declaration. ♪ Vali Vijelie ♪\n\"My enemies envy me\" In 2015, Mina threw a glitzy wedding bash graced by big-name singers whose fees\ntopped his official annual income. His marital godfather was the PSD’s kingpin\nin Giurgiu, Niculae Bădălău. And from Marian for his marital godmother! For Mr Bădălău's wife! A year later, Mina became\nthe leader of Giurgiu County Council, smoothing his path to the chairmanship\nof the PSD's Giurgiu association. Let me thank the party’s leaders, who stood by me today and gave me\ngreat strength, which I admit I needed. With the clout of Romania's biggest party\nbehind him and an MP’s badge on his lapel, Mina still seems to loom large\nover the checkpoint system. An associate of his – the husband\nof a fellow PSD member and MP – was put in charge of the Bucharest DRDP,\nwhich runs the Giurgiu crossing. He is Daniel-Augustin Dinu,\nthe husband of Cristina-Elena Dinu MP. He landed this job after press articles\nhad announced in advance that he'd win the post of\nmechanical engineer with the Buzău DRDP and then be seconded directly\nto the top job in the Bucharest DRDP. The fact that Mina retains more than\nan emotional tie with the Giurgiu crossing was confirmed to us during our research. The day after we confronted Daniela Costea, who is seen as a protégée of Mina,\nsomething interesting happened. Giurgiu Pe Surse suddenly posted\nan article entitled “Mina to be attacked” saying a report on a probe would soon appear\nin a Bucharest publication. It said the item would touch on\ncorruption at border crossings and that a basis for political revenge\non Mina was being cooked up. The PSD’s Giurgiu boss makes no secret of his close ties with control officers. Our sources say he meets\ncheckpoint officers every Saturday at the same time and restaurant. We wanted to verify\nour sources' information, so we waited outside for him\none Saturday morning. Hello, Mr Mina. Alex Nedea from Recorder.\nWe're journalists from Bucharest. We want to ask why you meet\nborder checkpoint staff at this restaurant at 10 am every Saturday. They're friends. I don't meet\ncheckpoint staff, I meet all my friends. Our sources say that as an MP,\nyou still coordinate… - As what?\n- As a politician. - No.\n- You don't coordinate checkpoints? I got out of that years ago, but… ...the great majority are my friends,\nmy colleagues, and of course I talk to them, why not? I’m glad you've contacted me because,\njust as you say you have sources, this report's the talk of the town here, and I was expecting you to contact me\nas that's only natural. In a town as small as Giurgiu,\nyou see, we hear things too. So I'm glad we're having this chat. Yes? Okay, so I want to ask:\nin 2014, you were head of the Bucharest DRDP. Yes. Why did you reinstate\nthe employees who’d been found, in an internal review,\nto have pocketed bridge toll payments? I don’t remember,\nbut I didn’t do it on my own. If they came back, it was with the approval\nof the director-general above all. I can’t remember,\nprobably due to a staff shortage, I can't think of any other reason. - A staff shortage?\n- Yes. There's still one now. But your colleagues had caught them\nfailing to collect bridge toll payments. I'm not the courts,\nit's not for me to convict them. No, but you were their boss. I think I suspended them, and later, due to\nunderstaffing, probably, I reinstated them. - Do you think that decision was right?\n- It didn't seem wrong in the circumstances. How could you afford musicians\nat your wedding? With my wages.\nWhat should I have had, a church choir? ♪ My enemies envy me\n'Cos I'm worth more than them ♪ ♪ And all their lives... ♪ You earned up to EUR 10,000 a year. I have receipts\nfor everything at my wedding. - Didn't you live off that money?\n- I have receipts for everything. Your asset declaration says\nyou earned up to EUR 10,000 a year. - Right.\n- How could you afford... Did I sit idle before that? No, but you made EUR 10,000 that year.\nHow could... Didn’t I work before then?\nWas I unemployed? Your income was modest. You're looking for a needle in a haystack.\nThat's what I think. - Okay, thank you.\n- You put a slant on everything...

Anastasiia se întoarce acasă", "published_at": "2023-02-23T18:31:37Z", "description": "În urmă cu exact un an, Federația Rusă a invadat Ucraina, declanșând o criză umanitară fără precedent. Milioane de oameni au plecat în exil, fugind din calea bombelor. Dincolo de susținere cu care au fost întâmpinați aici, pentru cei mai mulți refugiați ucraineni ajunși în România, fiecare moment din ultimul an a fost o luptă constantă între două gânduri: „Să rămân aici, departe de război” sau „Să mă întorc acasă, ca să lupt alături de familia mea care suferă”. Asta e ce a simțit zi de zi, oră de oră, Anastasiia Konovalova, o tânără profesoară de limba engleză din Odesa care s-a refugiat la București în urmă cu un an. În ultimele 12 luni, am încercat să surprindem momentele importante din viața Anastasiiei în România. A fost un an plin de neliniște, dar și plin de speranță.\n\n---------------------------\n\nRecorder este o publicație online construită de o echipă de jurnaliști în jurul acestor principii: jurnalism onest, făcut cu pasiune și pus în serviciul public. \n\nMai multe clipuri produse de noi sunt pe: \n\nsite: https://www.recorder.ro\n\npagina noastră de Facebook https://www.facebook.com/myrecorder\n\ncontul de Instagram https://www.instagram.com/recorder.ro/\n\nNe puteți urmări și pe Telegram: https://t.me/redactia_recorder", "transcript": "Going back in time, I remember, you know, \nthe full lost of hope. Complete fear,   I had no expectations at all and to my huge regret \nand shame I didn't know anything about Romania. ANASTASIIA RETURNS HOME When you leave your life, you have plans, you \nhave hopes you believe that the world works   in a way that you have a tomorrow and you can plan \nit and then in one day it's broken. And then it's a   huge wound, it's like everything is broken, not \njust your life,  but everything you believed in.   But then you come here. And it feels like every \nday, brick by brick, people here are putting you together  This year was healing, which is weird \nbecause it should have been the worst year, in my life  - and it also was\nwas the worst year - but at the same time,  staying here in Romania for a year \nit really gave me, um... You know... Hope! Ukraine! Above all! Good people, you remember how we used to gather at the beginning of the Ukrainian school year... We need make a circle here, so the kids can meet their teachers. Please find the sign with your child's class written on it... It has been a month since the war has started.  And we decided to start - not school - but a small \nproject. And we basically... the first step we took   was: we came to Gara de Nord (trainstation) and I actually \nyelled at the station that \"We are teachers!\"   \"We want to teach, we need to teach, help us to find \nplace...\", and then there was a chap waiting for   a train and he said: \"OK, look, the mayor wrote \nsomething about a center for Ukrainian kids\" \"Go there! Stop being here and scaring people!\". \nThis is the treasure of our nation, our children.   I think it's the scariest thing with the kids,\nbecause this this child view of this situation   is just... They can't understand everything and \nthe thing they're saying... Like, they're fine now,   but when you see a child smiling and saying: \n\"You know ,I spent two weeks in the basement!\"... We escaped from Kiev, it was a complicated \nsituation there. And they passed many days   without contact, without normal life, so here \nis the chance for them to have a normal life. You know, we started from 250 children at \"Mihai Viteazul\" College. And now our association teaches   2.700 children all over Romania... \nThis is a huge responsibility I saw a lot of empathy in trying to integrate our \nchildren in the school process. Kids are superheroes in   terms of healing themselves. They are older \nnow than they should be. They don't   see the world in black and white - and they're \nsupposed to, because they're kids - but now  they know that sometimes you just have to wait and \nyou can't do anything and even Santa Claus won't   bring you your dad across the border... So when \nI look in their eyes, especially some of them,   sometimes it's scary, because I look in the \nadults' eyes. And it's just the experience that   they've been through... they look like normal kids,\nbut sometimes it's just, boom!, something is wrong. So we use each and every opportunity we \ncould to show them that they're capable of   being helpful. And actually it feels \nvery good when you can do something. We're going to clean the forest. And we \nhave about - I think - 40 people in our team,   but maybe there will be more, because \nsome are coming by their own transport.   We can't do a lot because we don't have \nanything here, but I mean... we can clean, of course! It's a demo thing, because when we come back to \nUkraine there will be a lot of things to to clean.  When people ask us \"How are you\" it's always...\nWe're good, we're surviving. I see a very dangerous   trait of children starting to perceiving \nthemselves as victims. You know: \" We're poor...\". \"There is a war...\" And it's very dangerous for... for a growing human \nbeing. They should be smoothly integrated in the   normal life, which is, for example, cleaning \nthe... I mean, doing something for other people,  rather than saying \"Oh, I'm so poor! And, for \nUkraine, can I get a free burger, please\"... We're going through hell... We had a child whom we \nbrought from Kiev. And because we live next to   the airport here, there are planes and she sat for \ntwo hours in the bathroom, we couldn't take her out. We have some kids from Bucha and Irpin... And, actually, \nI haven't seen them for three days already. I mean, they don't come to school maybe \nthey don't have strength to come.   I hope their mothers didn't show them, but the fact \nis that kids see everything and hear everything... Now, they say people who survived Holocaust,\ndo you know what they said? That the   first people who broke were those who \nthought that it wasn't gonna last long.  And there were those were people who thought \nthat it would never end and these people who   just kept going, focusing on every day, they \nmanaged to survive. So this is our strategy... Mom, look! What is it? I found this. You found it?  Yes! It's from a tank! Lena, what's this? Don't touch it... Don't touch!!! I don't know what it is.  It's from a tank! Looks more like a mine... Stop! Don't get close, let's go... This year, I think I got older, I got 10 years older. And \nwiser and I can't believe it's only one year...   What was the hardest thing? The news. Your news \nare always with you.... Every time the alarm goes on in some parts of Ukraine, you start, \nyou know, in the back of your mind you're praying for   you know, for it to pass and for nobody to \ndie. But every time, all the time somebody dies... And now, at this point, everybody has somebody\nwho is dead in the war. Now everybody I know got   traumatized or wounded or died in this war... This visit is very important for political news \nbecause Dr. Biden is coming to see Ukrainian   children  - which means America supports Ukraine.\nBut this is not about meeting Dr. Biden and   becoming best friends. Somebody from the US Embassy \nwrote me at 10 PM saying that Dr. Biden has heard   about you. I thought \"Well, she didn't, but thank \nyou for trying to make me feel good\".    Now the world wants a new picture. Now the world doesn't \nwant to hear about how Ukrainians are struggling,  they want to see how Ukrainians are being \nintegrated and how they're becoming happy again.  But then, when you're speaking about \nUkrainians abroad these are the lucky Ukrainians   who are abroad... No ukrainians feel safe, either \nabroad or in the country. Everybody here is sure nothing will happen. But we know that you can't \nbe sure in tomorrow. At the same time, this gives   you this wonderful opportunity to enjoy every \nday of your life. So, I mean... Oh, wonderful! Sun! What are you doing, guys? Oh, butterflies! I want to say that I believe in magic and I believe in God.\nAnd I want to say that each magic which happened   in our life came through the people.  Thank you for coming, first of all, thank you for for being  interested in us. Well, Svetlana's project started from love. My project started from fear...   I crossed the border with my two-year-old son and \neverything I was thinking about is how to save my child from a city which was bombed. But then when \nI came here, and the first fear was gone, but then I   saw all these children being literally abandoned \nbecause, they came with their mothers who were   going through hell... With families being torn \nwith our husbands staying behind us... And you're just being thrown out of your life, going nowhere... \nWe didn't know where we were going, we have no friends, no relatives here... Thank God the Romanian \npeople were here for us and they helped us so much. The First Ladies does her business, we are just... What? \nUkrainian refugees? Whatever, she doesn't care about...   ... us. She cares about the big picture. But so many \npeople who actually care about our children, really... And you can see it, and these... these\nwere more important. For me, the important visits were, you know, when \nour head teacher of \"Mihai Viteazul\" College, Liliana, comes and sees if we need something. But I can see a huge level \nof support. It's not that emotional as it was... But it can't be, it shouldn't be. And also, \nto be fair, it's so it's such a relief that   you don't attract that much attention as \nit was before. Before we were all heroes...  It's so good not to be a hero. Just a person, just a normal person in the tram... And when you become a normal \nperson it's much easier.  Because I I really hate this, I hate the term \n\"hero\", because \"hero\" is something positive, right?   And there is nothing positive \nin what we're going through. Anastasiia before was... still a... still a child. Now nothing is me me is childish \nanymore, this is for sure,  because  when you when you walk across the border...\nwith your kid... well, it changes you forever. You can survive everything, but how \nyou come out from this fight, you know?   Do you keep your dignity?\nDo you feel you're a human? Are you a survivor? Or a victim? So, definitely \nI'm not a victim and I don't know victims. The most vulnerable people are there. They can't \nleave. Here we have people who have cars,   who have experienced traveling, who have \nsome form of education. There we have   the most vulnerable people. That's why we chose to be there. This is the second hardest decision in my \nlife: after I decided to leave the country,   I'm deciding to go back. I got a job in an NGO.\nThis NGO works with rebuilding schools,   rebuilding kindergartens, making safe basements but \nalso dealing with educational programs. I would be   an idiot if I wasn't afraid. Yes, of course I'm \nafraid! Because I'm bringing my three-year-old,   a happy three-year-old, integrated in this society, \nback to war. But, at the same time, I can't live   watching the news and thinking I should be \nthere. They're suffering, it's not... It's not   going to be over, I know I can help, because \nI have - you know - internal resources, I'm just   more resistant than other people, for some reason \nthis is who I am. I can help and I'm here...   So, yeah, I'm going back with a lot \nof... things I've learned here. Good morning! We dropped a banana... You know, it's a huge relief to make this \ndecision to come back, because finally...   I can be there...  Mama?  Yes, my love... Will we see the sea from the window? The sea? Yes. Sure we will... My son... I'm not sure he knows what \"Dad\" means...\nAnd people who live there they tell me: \"Anastasiia, are you sure you can do it? Because you \ncan't imagine\".  And how can you imagine? So, yes, of course I'm afraid. Especially... \nI mean, if only I was alone, but I'm with my son... So, for us, for my husband and me \nthis was the most difficult decision. Seems surreal it has been a year...  I respect every decision that's made now. Because nobody should be forced to choose between your \ncountry and your family.  I will learn how to react on alarms.  I will find a kindergarten for \nmy son which, has a good basement and generators... And then I will start my work. This is \nthe thing: we have to learn to live in   new Ukraine, because old Ukraine is not possible \nanymore. Even if we win the war tomorrow... Happiness is where home is. "}

Numai în luna octombrie, într-un interval de două săptămâni, la Garda de Mediu Ilfov au fost înregistrate peste 400 de sesizări pe acest subiect, dar fără niciun rezultat. În ultimele săptămâni am încercat să căutăm o explicație pentru acest fenomen pe care autoritățile par să se ferească să îl lămurească. \n\n---------------------------\n\nRecorder este o publicație online construită de o echipă de jurnaliști în jurul acestor principii: jurnalism onest, făcut cu pasiune și pus în serviciul public. \n\nMai multe clipuri produse de noi sunt pe: \n\nsite: https://www.recorder.ro\n\npagina noastră de Facebook https://www.facebook.com/myrecorder\n\ncontul de Instagram https://www.instagram.com/recorder.ro/\n\nNe puteți urmări și pe Telegram: https://t.me/redactia_recorder", "transcript": "In the last few months, the inhabitants of South Bucharest and Ilfov County have reported intolerable smells which emerge especially after night fall. A very toxic smell. A smell of gas, which spreads only at night. Most of the complaints came from Popești Leordeni, a city situated on the outskirts of the capital. In the evening you get home, and maybe you try to ventilate the room, the house is stuffy, you want to open the windows, it’s impossible! Exactly leachate, the smell of leachate. It smells… very, very foul! Picture that you are coming back from work, you are hungry and you eat in a privy. A smell of… vacuum truck combined with gas. Imagine that you live in an apartment, you close the windows and turn on the gas stove. We’ve looked into it and it seems to be sulphur.  Hydrogen sulphide.  It triggers the gas alarm. I’ve ventilated the kitchen, this smell came through and it triggered the gas alarm. Ilfov’s county Environment Agency recorded over 400 complaints in just two weeks. We’ve had enough of filing complaints. We file them and don’t even receive a reference number, nothing at all. When I rang Ilfov’s Environment Agency two weeks ago that lady told me “we are aware of the problem, but we don’t know the source’’ How is possible to have, at least on paper, an infrastructure which supposedly watches over the health of the environment, so by default of the citizen, and when I ring you tell me “I have no clue”. In an answer to Recorder, Ilfov’s Environment Agency admits that, lately, it received a large number of complaints about a strong smell of hydrogen sulphide and, as a result, the EA commissioner's attention was drawn to the landfill from Vidra. Situated 7 kilometres away from Popești Leordeni, the landfill from Vidra is the last active one in the area. Ilfov’s EA claims that it audited this landfill and found some irregularities for which fines were issued, but the latest measurements taken by the Environmental Protection Agency do not exceed the legal limits of Hydrogen Sulphide, with the exception of a couple samples of short duration. EA’s answer, in reality, says that they cannot be certain if the landfill from Vidra is the source of the reported smells, but also cannot exclude the possibility, because hydrogen sulphide smells even when it’s within legal limits. There are people for who this smell is not a recent problem and who completely lost their trust in the authorities’ measurements and assessments. I’m Marius Stratulat, 35 years old,\n  and I’ve lived in Vidra all my life. I became neighbours with the landfill in 2000. I was a teenager then, about 15-17 years old, not sure how old I was. People were delighted that someone came to the village, that they would create jobs, that we would not have to pay the fee to get the rubbish picked up, that it would offer better opportunities than just a dump.  I’m biassed when it comes to the dump. The air in the morning smells exactly like a cesspit. But not just in the morning. Also late in the evening and at night.  Initially, there were 600 metres to the dump, but meanwhile, it expanded, reaching 500 metres, so we are only separated by half a kilometre. I didn’t sit idly.  I have shown the problems that we experience. That it stinks, that the water began tasting, smelling and looking bad. Authorities said that it shouldn’t smell and that it doesn’t have any signs of pollution. The landfill from Vidra has been active since 1999. Since then, the company that runs this business has committed to limiting, as much as possible, pollution and unpleasant smells. After Romania joined the European Union, these norms became even more severe, and the regularly issued licence states that the operator from Vidra must ensure that the dump does not emit any smells. In other words, to be an ecological site. An ecological waste site must meet several requirements Firstly, its base must have a waterproof layer  covered with a special membrane that doesn’t allow any leakage into the soil and groundwater   of leachate - the liquid that results from the decaying waste. European norms say that leachate must be collected and treated, and the waste must be constantly covered with soil to get rid of the smell. But this process is not permanent because the waste ferments under the soil and it creates gases that need to be constantly removed. These gases should be collected and transported through pipes towards a combustion plant. An efficient combustion is made at high temperatures of at least 1000 degrees Celsius which ensures total decay and removes any unpleasant smell. However, things are not that straightforward. The gas that is collected from a landfill is a mixture of methane gas, hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide and other gases resulted from its fermentation. When this mixture contains too little gas that burns, the operator has to supplement with methane gas from the national supply, which involves additional costs. If the combustion plant works normally, ecological landfills should not give off any unpleasant smell. If, however, those gases are not burnt efficiently, they can be carried away - depending on the temperature and the direction of the wind - towards populated areas.  The authorities responsible for environmental protection should be constantly checking if these gases are burnt correctly or not, but until now no such irregularities have been found, although the nearby citizens regularly complain about this hydrogen sulphide smell. They said that there are no findings about the smell that we experience. ‘’ It doesn’t smell, no way it does’’. Well, come at the time of day when the smells were reported. ‘’ We cannot do that, to send the team at whatever time you want’’. OK, then I will make my own findings. So I bought a sensor that measures air quality which measures even hydrogen sulphide that is responsible for intense smells. We have here a sensor from Ioa Airly, I don’t mean to promote them but it’s one of the best sensors. I have followed its measurements for quite some time. Everything is exceeded by more than 100%. Very rarely does it go under the legal limits. The results recorded by Marius Stratulat’s sensor, who lives in the vicinity of the landfill from Vidra, contradict the many measurements made by the Environmental Protection Agency. Institutions’ representatives refused to give us an interview where we could clarify these inconsistencies. We discovered, however, a possible explanation from George Gârbacea who ran the Environment Protection agency last year and claims that the measurements performed by the institution are superficial.  Last year, in the summer, there was a campaign which monitored hydrogen sulphide in the north of the capital. And the problem was that, according to the monitoring data, everything was fine, but the measuring technique was averaging it out over two days. They could release them, which is very easy, see in which direction the wind is blowing, know where the monitoring station is and release. Let it out for three hours while the wind blows in the opposite direction. They knew that they were being monitored. We have published that report saying that everything is fine, although… I have apologised to the people, I knew it stank. They would contact me and I’d say ‘’The measurements are fine, you know?’’ After some time, I was even ashamed. Obviously, it is a problem that can be solved very easily through an environmental agreement which imposes monitoring and real time data transmissions to the public. It shouldn’t smell. If all the institutions would do their job… It shouldn’t smell. Do you feel the smell? Yeah, it’s dump, hydrogen sulphide, not trucks. So we are getting close. Yes. It’s a stingy smell. And this is the smell that reaches every night… Bucharest. Octavian Berceanu is the former head of the Environmental Guard and one of the activists who has been involved, in recent years, in finding sources of pollution around Bucharest. It’s Bucharest’s landfill. The front area is in big part covered, we can see some stripes across the landfill  which are the pipes that pick up some of the gases. On the way here we all felt how the air smelt very heavily of hydrogen sulphide. This hydrogen sulphide smells like bad eggs and it’s the gas that comes from the rubbish we throw in a heap.  It should be picked up and neutralised. The smell is proof that it wasn’t neutralised. To neutralise it, you need methane from the national network and with its help to burn this landfill gas. I have been to similar dumps and entered the… operational and observational centre of the landfill  and the burning was taking place at 300 degrees, basically letting it go in the air to stink next to a big city. I entered to see why it was smelly and reached that operational panel  and noticed that instead of 800-900 degrees Celsius to neutralise the gases, there were only 300 degrees. This means that you basically let them go in the air and there is a metre that measures it which can show, in court, that you have ''burned'' them. And the head from Environmental Protection just closed their eyes, as it usually happens. And what did you tell them then? You were their boss then.  Yeah. Sadly, at that moment we didn’t have the proper procedures and legislation  in place to allow me to fire those people. I left… and the authorities have never delivered legislation or procedures that can allow me some proper inspections and audits which I can take in court to show what is going on, with some proof for it. Although it’s a situation which you have noticed Which we all notice! Is out in the open. The illegal burnings that take place as we speak, are out in the open, we feel the hydrogen sulphide smell Obvious things that state institutions, which are extremely corrupt, hide. According to the records, Vidra’s landfill made an investment in the equipment that collects and neutralises the gas. Four years ago, the town hall audited the activities of the landfill. During their visit, the specialists noticed that at that moment, Although added to the records, the burning chamber and its addition was not working. Since then, no one has publicly recorded what has happened with the equipment that is supposed to burn those gases. If everyone from the area is complaining, something is definitely wrong. Certainly and very confidently I can say that it’s the landfill from Vidra. There are no other sources. To save some money, they dump it in a controlled manner, the gas that results from the decomposition in the atmosphere without having burnt. Methane gas, yes? It’s not in a big concentration. There is sulphur… you need to bring in some more gas and burn it at high temperatures. And it’s cheaper to dump it in the atmosphere than to burn it. We have tried to find out how the installation works from Eco Sud’s representatives, the company that manages the landfill and who, only in the previous year,  reported, from waste management activities, a turnover exceeding 34 million euros. We kept having audits in this time of the year and the results were that the complains were not related to the landfill from Vidra, especially that labs from Environmental Protection Agency made some measurements and the results do not exceed hydrogen sulphide limits and so on. There is a sensor in Vidra that measures an excess of hydrogen sulphide next to the landfill. Are you aware? No, about the Airly sensor I don’t know. I’m aware it exists and there were talks, at the level of the authorities, that is not a certified sensor and not necessarily unbiased in its measurements. Nevertheless, the levels being exceeded so much, be it certified or not, should raise some questions.  Will you take some actions, will you check? Yes, as I’ve told you… To monitor individually? Beyond our own internal measurements that we make following specific regulations, measurements were made by the labs of Environmental Protection Agency Bucharest which I’m certain that it has all the required accreditations.  No exceeded levels were observed. This smell is there. Basically, even if there are no exceeded levels, the smell is there. And I want to ask you: Did the combustion chamber not work properly or? No way, the combustion chamber works, it continuously monitors the daily operations, nothing even close to that. We consider that there are sources beyond Vidra that seem to be the cause. We are all very aware of the activities from Sintești, which are notorious… True, but that smell is different compared to the one of illegal dumping, those exist too, indeed, This is the smell of hydrogen sulphide, which is a landfill gas… I repeat: I don’t believe it and through all our measurements and involvement in this problem there are also all the extra analyses from the third parties too. Sure, is there a chance that we could see how this combustion chamber works? The burning system? Sure. Yes, you submit a request and of course you can. So far, we haven’t received any answer to our request to view the landfill’s gas burning facility. The representatives of Environmental Guard refused to sit down with us for an interview, but reassured us that they monitor the situation from Vidra and the smell reported by the people. In the coming years, the dump from Vidra will reach its full capacity. A period of 20 years follows after its closure where the landfill has to be monitored constantly. Together with the sensor I bought a camera too. I aimed it specifically for the dump. People didn’t believe me when I said that it smells, so I bought a camera so they can see what I see and what I feel. Because I have started fighting against the dump, suddenly thugs appeared at my doorstep, who wanted to offer me ‘’protection’’... and they said ‘’Are you the one messing with the dump? Stop it, that’s not good!’’ The people who keep quiet are the ones that are afraid. You are trying to fight the system, but is not possible because thugs appear just like it happened to me, the authorities show up and are on their side, what can you do? ‘’I’m insignificant and don’t stand a chance against them’’. So you mind your business. There are 500 metres between me and the dump. My neighbour doesn’t allow me to live peacefully and I don’t like that. Believing in a change and that a different political party, different people will come to change something,  I have created a piece of heaven for disabled people and medical recovery. I find myself having to give up my business…what can I do? Load it on a trailer and move it somewhere else? I don’t want to do that. And why would I give up my life, for someone who doesn’t want a better life quality."}

Romanians have a lot of faith in you. Radu… That’s why General Ciucă\nhas a great reputation. He served in combat zones and was wounded. In the Battle of Nasiriyah,\nhe led this battalion... Marcel Ciolacu will drop\na bombshell live tonight. The PSD leader will expose #Rezist\nprotesters’ crimes live... My guest is Home Secretary Lucian Bode. Good evening! Many thanks for the peonies! - I hope they’re…\n- Yes, thank you. Yes, lovely. A short break… Familiar TV images like these sum up\none of society’s biggest problems: the cosy relationship between\njournalists and politicians. - Good luck!\n- Thank you! The line between the two camps\nhas gradually blurred. Their roles are less clear and the media\nhas lost sight of its duty. Perhaps my guest, Gabriela Firea,\nwill shed some light tonight because she’s always been honest. This is \"The Laws of Power\".\nI’m Alexandra Păcuraru. Big or awkward issues are avoided, parties fund journalists’ wages directly\nand politicians are fawned over, not grilled. Please tell the nation what happened: who these manipulators are, what they\ndid to you, the proof of the theft and the plan to destroy\nand smear Gabriela Firea with this untrue propaganda. This unnatural situation\nthreatens a democracy. In a democracy, the media and politicians\nshould never be on the same side. We elect politicians to govern us. An imaginary dividing line\nseparates them from us. We remain ordinary citizens\nand they gain power over us. To stop them abusing that power,\nwe need checks and balances. One important curb is the media. Journalists should watch politicians\nand hold them to account on our behalf. If they stop doing this and go over\nto the politicians’ side, a curb on power is lost and the line becomes a wall behind which\npoliticians feel unaccountable. The deal that most of the media\nhas struck with parties is worth millions of euros a year and we foot the bill. Parties take public money\nand give it to the media to buy its obedience. What lies did they tell about you? ...in other media outlets, to discredit me. The financial relationship\nbegan with elections. Parties used to pay for campaign adverts which the press and TV channels\nkept separate from other content. Young people must be prominent in politics\nand fight for a better future. In Europe, without your people,\nyou’re a nobody or a servant! USL! USL! USL! But later, parties started buying\neditorial content by paying for shows discreetly labelled as\n “electoral promotion” in which journalists’ presence\nwas purely ornamental. Victor Ponta is PRO România’s leader\nand an election candidate. Good evening! This is electoral promotion, so I’ll\nbe taking a back seat tonight. That cost more, of course,\nbut parties didn’t mind because we, not they, picked up the tab. The law lets parties grab hefty sums\nfrom the public purse for electioneering. In the last four elections\nheld in 2019 and 2020, they paid the media over\nEUR 22 million in total. They and the Permanent Electoral Authority\nrelease campaign spending figures but don’t say how much each\nmedia outlet gets from parties. Recorder has come by a contract dated 2019\nfor the presidential election campaign between the Social Democratic Party (PSD)\nand Ridzone Computers, one of the firms behind România TV. The first thing that stands out\nis the confidentiality clause. It says neither party can disclose any\ndetails without the other’s consent. Parties are supposed to spend\npublic money transparently and TV channels should track its use. But here, the PSD and Ridzone kept shtum\nabout what they were doing with public money. The schedules to the contract show the PSD\npaid up to EUR 3,000 ex VAT a minute. As well as campaign broadcasts,\nit bought “electoral promotion” shows. I’ve kept my word. The PSD's leader and presidential\nnominee, ex-PM Viorica Dăncilă, has chosen România TV for\nher last campaign interview. - Thank you for joining us!\n- Good evening… This show cost EUR 80,000 plus VAT. So that's nearly a whopping\nEUR 100,000 for a chat lasting less than an hour,\nor EUR 35 per second. This fuels suspicions that the channel’s\nfavour was bought as well as the airtime. Weigh it up! A man who was\nan MEP for nine years… I investigated Iohannis’s houses and court\ncases, you needn’t convince ME! Many viewers of shows like this don’t\nrealise the party bought the airtime and the presenter is not a journalist\nwith a free hand, but a host who has to make the paying guest look good. Mr Iohannis has to explain why… You’re the only one who’s\nexplaining here, I'm sorry! - Yes.\n- Hello. Mr Victor Ciutacu? - Yes.\n- I’m Victor Ilie, a reporter at Recorder. We’re making a video documentary\nabout parties' payments to the media. We'd like to ask whether you feel\nyou can be objective as a journalist when the media firm you work for\nis funded by political parties. Do you have a document saying it is? I’m not involved in the channel’s\ncommercial affairs and I couldn't care less whether\nany party funds it or not. For example, we have a contract\nbetween RTV and the PSD for a show you hosted with\nex-PM Viorica Dăncilă. The show cost EUR 100,000. We’d like to ask you about that. All this is news to me. I know nothing about the PSD funding\na show I did with Viorica Dăncilă. When you’re live with a guest like her\nand you see “election debate” on the screen, don't you behave differently? No, I haven’t done that in 25,\nnearly 27 years of journalism… I very much doubt I could do that\nwith her or any other prime minister. It doesn’t influence me at all\nand I’m not privy to backroom stuff. One of my terms when I work for a channel,\nand I haven't worked for many, is that I’m not told about\nthe group's commercial affairs. The only commercial thing\nI care about is my contract. So you have no issue with parties\nfunding the media with public money. I’ve got no issue with the state\nchipping in to keep a profession afloat when the media falls on hard times. We don’t know how much RTV\ngets from the PSD… That’s none of your business, it's private! It’s the public’s business to know\nwho funds a channel. Maybe your viewers want to know.\nIt’s great that you tell them. And do you think yours don’t want\nto know what the PSD pays… How do you know what they want? I’m asking YOU: don’t they want to know? I don’t really know what they want. More and more of them seem\nto want to see me on TV and I try to keep them tuning in. The signs that parties buy more than just\nelection services grow even stronger when we read Schedule 3\nto the contract, which says EUR 69,000 ex VAT was paid for coverage of\na press conference given by Viorica Dăncilă. That’s suspicious to say\nthe least, as news channels automatically cover presidential\ncandidates’ conferences in a run-off. I still think a debate is needed… It makes no sense for a party to pay\na channel that would have attended anyway. Other channels also labelled this event\nas an “Election Debate”. This suggests RTV wasn’t the only\nchannel that the PSD paid for it. Whether the media loves you or loathes you, I believe you have to treat it fairly. Politicians and the media grew fond of\nthe arrangement used for elections whereby parties paid and the media\ndanced to their tune. Naturally, they wanted to use it\noutside campaign periods too, and that became possible in 2018. The state is gifting parties\na big revenue boost. A change in the law will mean\nmore cash from now on. Parties’ monthly grants from\nthe state have kept on rising. In that year, a parliamentary bloc with\na majority led by Liviu Dragnea bumped up grants considerably. Grants are monthly payments\nto parties from the state. The sudden hike opened doors for parties. Now that the law let them spend\ngrants on publicity with no cap, they began paying megabucks to media groups\nevery month, not just during elections. Big talk shows turned into\nsoapboxes for politicians. Marcel Ciolacu is taking\nemergency measures. We’ll now bring you the PSD leader’s\nresponse to the recent attacks. The PSD leader will expose\nthe new regime’s crimes. Ciolacu will reveal all. The PSD leader will expose\n#Rezist protesters’ crimes. Marcel Ciolacu will drop\na bombshell live tonight. Nearly RON 1 billion went to parties\nin grants over the last four years. That’s EUR 200 million. Much of that went to the media. Firstly, thank you very much for coming! The media and parties wanted\nto hide these deals and constantly refused to say\nhow much public money was being spent on what. An NGO took legal action over the issue. We at the Centre for Public Innovation are taking legal action against parties\nfor refusing to tell us how they spent public money\nand give a list of the contracts. Only the USR replied, so we had\nto take the rest to court. We won against the smaller ones but the PSD and the PNL\nare still holding out on us. Freedom of information cases\ntake years in Romania. Cristian Andrei of Radio Free Europe\nis one of the few journalists who have pressured parties\nover this issue in recent years and explained the implications to people. Party leaders are becoming private\ninvestors in the media, without being upfront about it, because they crave control\nover information. This public money is just feeding an increasingly servile media that's more to the liking\nof the party that pays. On Romanian websites, the “P” label\nisn’t shown to indicate publicity, so we don’t know if an article was paid\nfor by the PSD, PNL, USR or whoever. We only know parties\npaid a lot to the media. We don’t know why, when or to whom. To find out who was being paid, Andrei\nsent countless enquiries to parties to ask what the media money\nwas being spent on. He eventually got some information but the PSD remained tight-lipped\nabout its spending. All the public knows is the total amount. For instance, the PSD gave the media\nnearly RON 40 million last year. That’s as much as we know because, under Marcel Ciolacu, the PSD\nhas stonewalled all requests for details. Recorder spent months trying\nto pierce the veil of secrecy in which Romania’s biggest party,\nwhich gets the biggest grants, shrouded the recipients of the hundreds\nof millions of lei spent on the media. Our starting point was an anonymous email with attached accounting documents belonging\nto the group that controls România TV (RTV). They included this proposed\ncontract that RTV received from a firm called Vertigo Events. It says Vertigo is an advertising agency\nacting for its client, the PSD. The firm has two employees and is completely\nunknown in the media agency sector. This led us to suspect the PSD\nwas using it as a front company to disguise its payments to media firms. Another attachment was a spreadsheet\nentitled “Parties – Statement”. It lists payments from most of the parties\nthat ran in the 2020 elections. The PNL, PRO România\nand the PMP paid directly, but the entries for the PSD say\n“billed to Vertigo Events”. The leak also included invoices\nindicating that Vertigo Events had made multiple payments\nto the firms behind RTV. These documents gave us reason to suspect\nthat the PSD had paid grant money to the media through a front company. But the attachments to the anonymous\nemail weren’t proof positive, so we went to the horse’s\nmouth for confirmation. One, two! Mike check… I’ve seen that in TV studios! We talked to PSD leader Marcel Ciolacu\nto find out how parties funnel public cash to the media. We had contracts with media agencies. You know the amount and how it’s spent… No, we don’t know how it’s spent! The amount is checked\nby all the authorities. If it’s spent illegally, the state\nis reimbursed as of right… No, you’ve got a huge problem\nwith transparency! Law 544 should give us\naccess to this information. Broken down? Yes! Where the money goes. - Oh, I didn't understand…\n- Right! Who gets it. You want the amounts for each\nwebsite and media firm… The other parties have published them, yes. Hm… I’ll ask the lawyers and firstly\nthe advertising agencies if they’ve got a problem… Excuse me, but it’s not up to ad agencies whether you\ncan say where public money goes! Let’s look at the business angle. No, this is about transparency\nover the use of public money. Okay, it IS transparent. We know\nhow much is paid directly. No, you’re refusing to say where\na LOT of public money goes. - I’m not.\n- You ARE! I have a contract with an agency…\na confidentiality agreement. It can’t be confidential\nif it’s public money! So we had confirmation that the PSD\npaid media groups through middlemen. And we knew why: to make the media groups'\nnames non-disclosable. I need to talk to the agency\nto see if I’d be in breach of a business contract if I gave that away. Your relationships with agencies\nmatter more to you than your relationship with the public\nwhose money you’re spending. No, what matters most is\nnot being prosecuted… What’s the problem? …or sued for disclosure\nor breach of contract. So the PSD was paying a fortune to\nmiddlemen and told us it couldn’t reveal where the money ended up\nwithout their consent. But its leader couldn’t keep ducking the issue\nwhen we pressed him to name the middlemen. - The agencies we work with are known.\n- Where are the names? I don’t know… at the\nPermanent Electoral Authority… - Don’t ask me for technical details.\n- Why not? So you’ve also hidden your\ncontractual partners’ names. They’re not publicly known… No, I’d think they ARE, from our reports to the Electoral Authority,\nthey should comply… Come on, this is public money. Is the law being broken? The PSD broke Law 544 on\nFree Access to Information of Public Interest by refusing to tell journalists how\npublic money was being spent. We eventually got the names of some\nintermediaries out of Ciolacu. We’re working with two agencies right now… Can you name them? Come on… Yes. Media something or other, and Vertigo. I got to know Vertigo when\nI took over as party leader, they worked with two other\nleaders, and Media… All Media and Vertigo. So the PSD leader confirmed\nto us that Vertigo, which had made several payments\nlisted in the RTV group’s accounts, had paid on his party’s behalf. This raised the question of how many media\nfirms had been paid through Vertigo. We went to see Cezar Batog,\none of its shareholders. - Hello!\n- Hello! I’m Victor Ilie, a reporter from Recorder. We’re making a documentary about the\nmoney political parties pay to the media. Since Ciolacu had said he couldn’t name names\nunless the middlemen's owners agreed, we wanted to see if they’d name\nthe groups they'd paid. We’re asking you because the PSD's\nrefusing to tell us under Law 544. Sorry, but… It’s refusing? Have you got a minute to\nlook at some documents? Sorry, no can do. Like I said, Vertigo has a contract… - With the PSD?\n- Yes. So the PSD and its middleman passed\nthe buck to each other when it came to transparency over this\ntop-secret spending. But we followed the trail of the money\npaid via Vertigo in recent years. We managed to find tax data indicating which media firms\nhad billed the PSD’s agent. We can now reveal what the\nPSD tried so hard to hide: how much it pays the media\nand who gets the most money. Between 2019 and this spring, the PSD paid Vertigo Events\nnearly EUR 15 million. Vertigo passed on more than\nEUR 14 million to media groups or firms linked to media outlets. The lion’s share went to groups that own\nnews channels directly or indirectly. We approached all of the media firms\nnamed in this video for comment in writing or by telephone. Mihai Gâdea, the CEO of Antena 3,\nwhich got the most from the PSD, didn’t answer our calls and asked us in WhatsApp to\nsend our questions in writing. An Antena 3 employee told us in writing\nthat the channel had no direct contracts with parties, but admitted\nit had several contracts with Vertigo Events,\nthe PSD’s intermediary. Antena 3 wouldn’t be drawn\non the services it provided for the money received from the PSD’s agent but said its editorial stance\nwas unaffected. I wouldn’t normally say this,\nbut that’s a lovely outfit. Thank you. My sister Nela made it… Breaking news! We also tried to get a response\nfrom news channel Digi24 by contacting Mihai Dinei, the boss\nof the company that owns it. - Yes.\n- Hello, Mr Dinei. - Hello.\n- I’m Mihai Voinea, a journalist at Recorder. I’d just like a minute of your time. We’re looking into the money\npolitical parties pay… I’m on leave, please would\nyou leave me alone? So you don’t want to respond to… - To what? I don’t know what this is about.\n- If you can give me 20 seconds… - No. I said I’m on leave, didn't I?\n- Who could I talk to…? - I don’t know.\n- You don’t know. - Okay.\n- Okay, thanks. We also phoned Eugen Chelemen,\nRTV’s executive editor. According to our information,\nfirms in the RTV group got about EUR 3 million from the PSD via\nVertigo Events in the last three years. - Right…\n- What did România TV do for that money? Please call the people\nwho handle that stuff. I have no duties at all in that regard\nunder my contract, I've no idea about that. So as executive editor, you don’t know about the money paid by\nparties to the RTV group? Not at all! So this money doesn’t sway the\ngroup’s editorial policy at all? Certainly not! I set the policy based on our performance\ncriteria to pull in viewers! We're watching live as Gabriela Firea\nand the mayor of District 4 visit a family with five\nchildren in Bucharest. Gabriela Firea and Mayor Daniel Băluță\nare springing a surprise on them. Vertigo paid not just groups\nowning TV channels, but also online media outlets. Firms with direct or indirect\nties to the likes of Adevărul, EVZ, Gândul, DC News\nand Știri pe Surse raked in cash from the PSD through Vertigo. I can assure you we don’t have\na contract with the PSD. Have you had any contracts with its agent,\nVertigo, in the last three years? Now that’s management information. By the way, how does Recorder make\nthe money it needs to pay wages? Most of it's donated by readers. And what have you done for these donations? Journalistic pieces.\nPeople donated voluntarily. We do those too… Right, but in your case, people’s\nmoney was taken by parties and given to you without people’s\nconsent or knowledge. You don’t know that. - Okay, that’s your opinion.\n- You don’t know that. So, you see…\nBest of luck to you! - Hello.\n- Hello! Mr Burci? - Yes.\n- I’m Victor Ilie, a reporter at Recorder. We’re making a documentary about\nmoney paid to the media by parties and I’d like to ask some\nquestions about Adevărul. I know nothing about that,\ntalk to Cristi Stancu. - Hello!\n- Hello! Mr Cristian Stancu? - Yes.\n- I’m Victor Ilie from Recorder. We’re investigating money paid\nby parties to the media… Please, I’m on leave… I’ll tell you… Leave it till…\nI’ll be back on Wednesday evening, okay? Okay. I’ll await your response. Cristian Stancu, Adevărul Holding’s\ngeneral manager, didn’t pick up on the day he’d suggested. There is no answer. Please… We’ll never find out where\nthe PSD’s money went! Many other online publications\nwere paid by the PSD’s agent. The PSD seems to have dished\nout money to all comers. Some publications get the\nsame amount every month. This is suggestive of a kind of\nprotection money or loyalty fee paid by the PSD to journalists. Hello, Mr Sabin Orcan? - Yes.\n- I’m Victor Ilie from Recorder. We’re making a video documentary about\nmoney paid to the media by parties. Do you have a few minutes? No, I don’t know about that,\nI’m not interested. Our information is that the PSD gives… - Listen, Victor!\n- Newsweek… Okay. I don’t want to appear on\nRecorder or anywhere else. - No comment, I’m not interested.\n- You WILL appear, this is your right of reply. Does the PSD pay you EUR 3,000\na month via Vertigo Events? I’m not interested. I told you,\nno comment, I’m not interested, I’m not interested, please. What’s the money for? I’m NOT interested. - No comment, okay? Good day!\n- It’s public money… We asked Marcel Ciolacu what the PSD\ngot for these monthly payments. He said it didn't make recurring payments, but the financial information\nwe saw says otherwise. I have a contract with an agency. Depending on what I want to promote, the agency will have contracts with\nwebsites, social media, etc. They don’t spend the same amount on\nparticular institutions every month. It depends on the addressability\nI want and the party I represent. Do you know that, or is it an assumption? I know it because it depends on\nhow we want to promote… It’s not constant. Marcel Ciolacu, the leader… Mr Ciolacu, everyone’s wondering\nif the government will fall. Our guest is the PSD leader… We’re in the office of PSD\nleader Marcel Ciolacu. Thank you for coming… Marcel Ciolacu will unveil the PSD’s\nplan to help Romanians cope with the cold and hunger this winter. Find out tonight at 9 pm in \"The Laws of Power\"\nwith Alexandra Păcuraru. Essential viewing! We’re back to following the money,\nas Vertigo Events isn’t the PSD’s only middleman. Marcel Ciolacu gave us another name: Media something or other, and Vertigo. “Media something or other”\nis All Media Company, an ad agency that works\nwith several parties. The PSD uses it for some payments to\nmake the money even harder to track by paying through two middlemen. Other parties pay All Media directly and it passes the money\non to media groups. But this agency offers parties\na big advantage. Unlike Vertigo, which works for just one party\nand doesn’t do any other publicity work, All Media works with several,\nand it’s not just a middleman. It also sells commercials. So if All Media pays a news\nchannel, it’s hard to know, without seeing all the contracts, whether\nthe money is for detergent ads or publicity for a political party. That’s why this diagram\nappears to show that All Media pays out more money\nthan it gets from parties. It also handles payments for commercials. Since parties and media groups hide their\nuse of public money by using middlemen to make it confidential, all we can do is look for clues in accessible data. All Media’s revenues skyrocketed in 2019, precisely when parties began spending\na king’s ransom on media and publicity. The milestone moment also impacted\nAll Media's dealings with TV news channels. All this information casting light\non payments between parties and media conglomerates\nraises a key question. How can parties pay TV channels\nwithout falling foul of the Broadcasting Act, which bans\npayments outside election periods? The answer lies in their ingenuity\nin cheating the law. Now let’s turn to the\nNational Liberal Party (PNL), which spent over EUR 25 million on media\nand publicity in the last four years. It’s been more open about its\nspending than the PSD, especially due to pressure from\nCristian Andrei of Radio Free Europe. Expert Forum, an NGO, has pulled\nthe PNL’s figures together. They show that the PNL is generous\nto many media firms. The Broadcasting Act doesn’t apply\nto online publications, which can be paid outside election periods,\nso the PNL pays them directly. But TV channels receive payments through\nfront companies outside election periods to get around the law so they don’t\nlose their broadcasting licences. B1 TV is paid via Ancore Media,\nwhich owns its website. The licence is held by another firm. Realitatea Plus is paid via a firm owned\nby the wife of its boss, Maricel Păcuraru. RTV uses an even more complex set-up.\nParties make payments to Stalex PR, which is owned by a friend of\nSebastian Ghiță, RTV’s owner. Stalex passes the money on to firms within\nthe group other than the licence holder. Ridzone Creative is a production firm and RTV Properties Management\nowns the RTV website. This chicanery makes it hard\nto track the money and work out exactly how much the PNL\npaid RTV in recent years. That information only appears\nin the contracts, which are protected with\nnon-disclosure clauses. And it’s not just the amounts\nthat are hushed up. Contracts like these contain another\nkind of sensitive information: the services media groups provide for\npayments made outside election periods. Among the RTV group files attached\nto the anonymous email was a contract that lends weight\nto growing suspicions that contracts include fake or grossly\noverpriced services and the money is a camouflaged bribe paid\nfor favourable coverage. Don’t cry, Rareș! Wait, old Brașov… This contract is between Stalex PR,\nwhich is paid by the PNL, and Ridzone Creative,\na member of the RTV group. It’s dated August 2019 and concerns filming\nservices listed in two schedules: 13 video clips of PNL leaders’ speeches,\nincluding nine from a congress and four from two other party meetings. Each clip cost EUR 5,000.\nThat adds up to EUR 65,000 ex VAT. But the PNL’s YouTube account shows the party\nmade its own recordings of these events, which it livestreamed so media\noutlets could air them for free. Snippets of speeches were later\nposted to its social media accounts. …to all PSD local councillors.\nThey’ve got no place in the PNL! Exactly the same thing happened\nwith President Iohannis’s speech, which was also listed in the schedule. The PSD has produced the most disastrous\ngovernment since the Revolution. A disgrace! It’s absurd that the PNL paid a\nproduction firm EUR 5,000 to make each clip, which would\nonly have involved a few cuts, not the filming, music and visual\neffects mentioned in the contract. The documents we obtained\nalso include a record stating that the videos were delivered to\nthe client on 30 September. But the PNL put its own clips\nonline before then. This suggests the contracted services were\nbogus and something else was paid for. There are hundreds of contracts like this\nbetween parties and the media for unknown services costing millions\nof euros of public money. Recorder received invoices made\nout to Vertigo, the PSD’s agent, by RTV Properties Management,\nwhich owns the RTV website. They say “online services”.\nThat could mean anything. The PSD gets around the Broadcasting Act\nin the same way as the PNL: it bypasses the licence holder and pays\nanother firm within the group. A channel like România TV\nis a group of firms. One holds the broadcasting licence\nand it’s illegal to pay it… Let me explain. Payments to the licence holder are illegal. But payments are made to sister\ncompanies, for different services. I definitely don’t pay TV channels. I’ve never asked anyone to\npay a TV channel. No way. What happens within groups… I’ve got just one group,\nthe PSD, it’s transparent… So we have parties that circumvent the law and politicians who feign ignorance\nof how their own scheme works. Why does a party pay a TV channel’s\nwebsite EUR 100,000 a month? Is it because the Broadcasting Act forbids\nyou to pay the channel directly? Do you influence it by paying\nanother group member? I say it's a rhetorical question.\nThe answer’s obvious. Of course I can’t prove it. But if we had\ndetailed information and the contracts, we’d know for sure if the information\ngiven to us by TV channels, which most people still get\nmost of their news from, is tainted by the public\nmoney we give parties. No one can say exactly why parties\npay all this money to the media. But we can hazard a guess. Every year, millions of euros change hands\nthrough these iffy, roundabout channels. Parties’ spending rivals that\nof big corporations. But when corporations pay media groups, we know what they pay for,\nas we see their adverts on TV. When parties pay, we can only speculate\nabout the quid pro quo. Worse, their leaders can’t give straight\nanswers about their spending sprees. The only demand I ever made\nwas that what the PNL did before and during campaigns\nwas reflected objectively. So you paid for objectivity? Yes. I wanted coverage of our events, press statements and press releases. Wouldn’t you have got that without paying? When the PSD was in office?\nUnder Dragnea? Ludovic Orban led the PNL\nfrom 2017 to 2021. The love affair between parties and\nthe media began during his tenure. A promise is a promise.\nThe prime minister, Ludovic Orban, is in the studio with me. Good evening, Prime Minister… His successor, Florin Cîțu, and current\nPNL leader Nicolae Ciucă refused to discuss how grants are spent. Radu… Here’s Marcel Ciolacu’s attempt at\nexplaining what the media is paid for. The law says “political publicity”. This is actually promotion… Every party has public policies.\nYou test and promote them. You put forward a policy you want to…\nFirst, you test it: forestation. Your targeting’s got to be right.\nThen you call agencies in. The agency automatically gives you\na report with feedback, responses… what people wrote on websites,\nthose who read, is it good or bad? I gather... I read some people\nwere for, some were against. You’ve got no way of testing whether what you think\nis what Romanians want. We’ve tested them all! And vouchers,\nwhere they should go… If you think that’s an incoherent answer,\nthen get this: the PSD splurged tens of millions of lei on this\nover the last three years. That makes the inability to explain\nall the more scandalous. We tried to pin him down. Leaders’ press conferences are promoted. When ministers come up with a public policy,\nwhat we want to... a party decision… It’s journalists’ job to go to conferences,\nparties shouldn’t pay them to go… - I don’t pay journalists.\n- What DO you do? I pay for promotion of a public policy. You lead the biggest party\nand the Chamber of Deputies. - I don’t have a contract with a journalist.\n- Okay, say it's with a media website. It’s not right. You hold a very high office\nand when you have a conference, publications will send someone anyway,\nthe party doesn't have to pay. Isn’t that logical? It is, but these things aren’t\nmutually exclusive. Because, naturally, I want my message to go out in a targeted way according to the public\npolicy’s addressability. That's meddling with the\npublication's editorial policy. No, not at all. You’re paying a journalist to target\nsomething specific during a conference. Hold on. The website doesn’t\nhave to do as I ask. There’s no obligation… My contract with the agency doesn’t\nmean I'm forcing the agency to make a journalist or website promote my… So what do you pay for? If I talk rubbish, do you think\na website will run it? I think not. It’s not clear what you pay for.\nIt’s still very vague. It's for feedback and\nopinions for and against so I can get a clear idea of whether what\nwe want to promote has addressability, if it’s what people want or not. I don’t get what the party gets in return. Public policy promotion\nand visibility on social media. They’d write anyway. A press conference doesn’t\nalways take you to where you want to go. Isn’t it obvious the publication will\nbe nicer to the party that paid? No, I don’t think so. I personally, Marcel Ciolacu, have never\nset out to buy or run the media. But if we look at Romania’s history,\nI don’t think anyone in Romania will ever run the media with money. That last remark by the boss of a party that\npumps millions of euros into media empires shows us how easily political leaders\nweave an alternative reality where lies are packaged as truths and\nobvious facts are denied calmly as there’s almost no one left to argue. As they gain a stranglehold\nover most of the media, politicians are steadily eroding\nthe pillars of democracy and creeping back towards an ever\nmore authoritarian system. This backsliding has come into\nplainer view in recent years. The biggest parties have united to form\nan almost unopposed mega-entity. The president is nodding his assent to\nthis trend like a silent supreme being. The secret services’ powers are unchecked and\nlaws to cement them further are on the way. Meanwhile, the media is taking parties’\ncash and looking the other way, avoiding topics inconvenient to the\ncolossus holding the levers of power. Over 50% of the population gets most\nof its news from TV.

I didn’t charge at you, and I didn’t attack you. What happened then?   If not that? But now you're questioning me? What happened then if you say you didn't attack me? I have a report where it says you were assaulted by a colleague  where no name, surname, or function is mentioned. If you say... I’m the one who attacked you,  this will lead to a horrible scandal and there will be consequences  for you, for me,  and others as well.  For me, it will be an unbearable scandal  because I have an impeccable reputation within this system, and everybody knows it.  Maybe the most impeccable within the whole system. This thing will throw me off  exactly where I don’t want to be thrown off. On the 19th of May, 2022 an employee of the Baia Mare Penitentiary went to the medical office of the institution and reported that she had been assaulted by another employee.  Due to her state of shock, she hesitates to declare in writing that the aggressor is the director of the institution, Horia Chiș.  The penitentiary doctor sees marks of an assault and recommends a forensic examination.  The assault is also confirmed by forensic experts. \"traumatic neck injury that could have resulted from the strangulation by hand and fingers\" The woman is given seven days of medical leave.  After a week, she returns to work, where she finds the incident is being covered-up.  From this moment on, she starts recording all the discussions with the director Horia Chiş and with the penitentiary therapist, Angela Kozma, the person in charge of mediating such conflicts. Therapist Angela Kozma: I want you to be aware that it's your word against the directors,  so here I can’t intervene… So, everyone can say their point of view. VICTIM OK. You said we need to talk, right? Yes, it’s important. Alright, so this means I can say what I need to say, even if that means I have questions, right? Yes, but it can’t be an interrogation. But it’s not an interrogation.  But for me, it’s very important   because I was traumatized then.  Believe me, I was never hit.  Not even by my parents.  No one did something like this to me, for me it was really traumatic. Director Horia Chiș: Yes, and I say I didn’t hit you. You choked me and pushed me towards the door.  That’s what you did.  And you know very well that’s what happened.  You and I know very well what happened then.  And I’m not lying.  And I say I’m not lying. And then when I came out of your office and I started to cry and shake, and  I had red marks around my neck? What happened? This conversation isn't going anywhere.  We can talk if we can’t… Yes, Angela, but this conversation is taking place because of what happened,  that’s why we’re talking now.   Because in the report written by the penitentiary doctor, the aggressor's name is not specified, the legal procedure makes the head of the prison, Horia Chiș, the one responsible for managing the conflict, even though according to the victim, he is also the aggressor.   I have no paper which tells me who the aggressor is… But you know who the aggressor is… You need to own up to it. In written, yes? You need to own up to it. In written, yes? If you think this is fair, true, honest… Yes, that’s the truth and you know it.  So please write it down:  “The aggressor is Horia Chiș Ștefan, Police Chief Commissioner, Director of the Baia Mare Penitentiary.” I will take your report, the doctors’ report and I will send it to NAP [National Administration of Penitentiaries]. Because he can’t investigate himself, it’s not ok…  And then we need to stop this and let Bucharest intervene… You will, probably, achieve a great outcome and I won’t be head anymore but not for long.  Because I am sure, absolutely sure, the court will prove I'm right. Yes, I’ll go and bring… Please bring the report, yes, to clarify. Horia Chiș exits the office to bring the report from the prison doctor, Andreea Boga. The victim is alone in the room with the therapist Angela Kozma. It’s your opinion you were assaulted, OK? Yes, that’s the truth.  But do you understand what I’m saying?  It’s your opinion you got assaulted. Yes, OK, I won’t give up, even if it’s the last thing I’m doing. OK. If after this whole story, I’ll be considered a liar… Yes... If you make peace with him, you’re not a liar  because you, as well as him, know the truth, and then… It’s important that he apologizes. But how will he apologize if he doesn’t admit it? Until we have the document that says you made peace, he won’t apologize. And believe me, I’m saying this in your favor. If we have the document, he will admit it. I'll keep the paper. Prison director Horia Chiș comes back inside the office. I’ll ask one more time: are we making peace? I can’t trust you.  Because you know very well after that happened,  when I wanted to leave the unit, about 20 minutes after coming out of your office,  when I came downstairs, you were in the courtyard. Yes, I was going to church. You were heading out, you saw me, started walking towards me, I told you I want to get out, I didn’t want to talk to you  after what happened.  OK... And you insisted to talk. OK... And you followed me and started to threaten me, you were saying... I don't think so. You don't remember? No, I apologized the first time, remember? Yes, yes, I remember.  Yes? You apologized for… I apologized because,  generally, I am extremely stern when it comes to Correctional [prison development project], yes? And because the event, whose nature we now need to decide on, took place.  What your impression is, what my impression is.  But I understand it moved you, it… It was distressing and I don’t want to see distressed people.  I want to see happy and calm people.  I don’t understand how I threatened you after, remind me. I don’t understand how I threatened you after, remind me. You told me: \"I apologize for what I did to you because you are a woman, because if you were a man, I wouldn’t have stopped there. \" That’s what you told me.  And you said it twice, you apologized twice.  Then, on the way out you said: \"I won’t stop until I destroy you, there is no way back now.\" And you know very well you told me that. No, that’s not true.  This is maybe from the intense feelings you were experiencing.  You never told me \"I will destroy you\"? No. You never told me \"I will beat you to death\"? No. You never told me I’m Satan and the devil? No. You never told me that? That I will beat you to death… That’s what you said.  That's not true. You never told me you are going to leave me without a job? But is this an interrogation? I want to see how much you’re willing to admit. Let’s clear these things out at the police station or with a judge, not here. If you want a war, let’s start the war,  but you know me very well and this war ... War means everyone will defend himself. will be tough and won’t end even when some verdicts will be given. NAP will come, they will interrogate us all, we will have to give statements  and I want this war to end. I’m responsible for the end of this war. So, our choice will determine what’s next, OK? If we choose peace, we will both have a normal life, but if we choose war, Russia-Ukraine awaits us.  To avoid any intervention from the National Administration of Penitentiaries superiors, the victim is pressed to write that the incident reported to the medical office of the institution has been resolved internally.  In this way, the aggression would be covered up, and the director's attack would have no consequences.  To convince the victim to accept the proposed plan, Horia Chiş offers her a solution along with some threats.  If you want to avoid this, I thought about the following solution: You never come into my office  and if I ever come into your office and you’re alone, I will leave and  come back when there are more people, so there is no confusion.  This will mean very little contact between us.  Please remember this.  If we choose peace,  and I think I told you before that peace is above justice,  I think it will last a lifetime. If we choose war, I’m sorry, but it will also last a lifetime.  You know me very well, you know I don’t back down.  And it will be very bad  and I think the stakes are, actually, pretty low and embarrassing and petty. If you want a prison without me, go ahead! I think you know I never wanted to hurt you. That’s exactly why I minded my own business and you know how many things I overlooked.  For two years.  And I was minding my business and I literally tried to forget.  You know how many times I cried, how many times…  I literally felt terrorized at work and I told you this before. And I kept hoping and hoping things will change. OK, and if you felt terrorized, why do you not accept this plan to no longer be terrorized, as you say? Because I think what happened last Thursday is very, very serious. I can’t make peace with someone who strangled me.  No, no, I can’t talk until we solve this.  Write down the name of the aggressor and let’s start.  But neither I, nor you want this. Please leave me alone with ***  to clarify this thing. The victim is again alone with therapist Angela Kozma, the person who should provide support to the prison staff whenever they need it.  In this case, however, her interest seems to be different. I don't care at all. If I managed to put myself under the safety net of a public institution, I don’t care about your personal conflicts.  Where you will destroy each other. Well, he will be ok after this, trust me. I don’t even want to let you be honest.  If I have the paper where you say you reconciled,  then we can truly start talking about it.  We can truly solve the issue and you will have long-term, guaranteed peace.   We can truly solve the issue and you will have long-term, guaranteed peace.   Do you get me? I’ll make him sign:  \"Long-term peace guarantee\". And you can negotiate for us, for all,  so this doesn’t happen again.  There will be no resolutions in a war, it’s one against the other.  That’s all.  And when there's one against the other, there will be collateral damage.  But I’m a survivor, I won’t be a victim, remember that. What you have from the forensic examination means nothing.   Nothing! Between the penitentiary and the forensic medical office, you could’ve banged your head across the steering wheel 100 times. All my coworkers saw that I was red. Around your neck. Here, here, here. And here. And it says that they conducted a general clinical investigation.  Do you understand? So you have nothing. That’s what you have.  Nothing. The only thing he cares about now is his reputation. For now. When that’s gone, believe me, he won’t care anymore.  And why should I try to protect his reputation now? Didn’t he know he has a reputation to protect?  Why do I have to compromise, to protect his reputation? It’s not like this. You don’t get it.  Your vanity is clouding your judgment.  When you choose peace, you say things happened and that you reconciled. And that you don’t have any claims. And that we can continue living together here, at work. I say you make peace for us, for all of us,  and for you too, because you also deserve peace and quiet. He will never, ever admit anything  and no one will declare anything against him.  Do you understand? But at least I know I tried. If you are Ecaterina Teodoroiu… You are not being rational here.  I’m saying this like a mother. You will be frustrated because you will not get justice. You think you've seen it all? I think you haven’t seen everything. I think you haven’t seen anything.  When someone doesn’t have anything left to lose, you’ll see what they are truly capable of.  We called Angela Kozma to get her reaction to the attitude she had during the talks with the employee of the penitentiary. Hello. Hello. My name is Isabela Pop and I'm a journalist for Recorder. I'm calling because we have some recordings  where you and an employee of the penitentiary discuss an assault that took place in the institution you work in.  The one accused of the assault is the director Horia Chiș. In the recording, it seems that you are insisting that the victim makes peace with the aggressor and that you encourage the cover-up of the case.  How would you explain your behavior? There’s no way I was doing that, I was not trying to cover up,   but there was no report saying the director was ***'s aggressor.  In the recording you say, and I quote: \"I think you should make peace for us, for us all, and for you, because you also deserve peace and quiet.\" Why did you insist that the victim reconciles with the aggressor? Firstly, I was looking for a way through which I can find the truth  and find a way to go about this from an institutional point of view.  As in, to have it written down. Did you find the truth? I didn’t find the truth because… I basically couldn’t find a way to uncover the truth.  Every time the victim was trying to talk about the assault,  you told her that there is no point in discussing it and insisted on a peace accord.  I felt… I couldn’t make a therapeutic alliance with *** because I didn’t feel she was honest. Did you think she was lying? That’s what I felt. Even though she has a forensic document confirming the fact that she got assaulted in the penitentiary by an employee? There’s no way I could know this.  I can’t know what the forensic examination says or what happened there. The director is a powerful person, one with a lot of influence, he says has an impeccable reputation… Yes. Why would an employee come and accuse him of such things? Money. I think the penitentiary director  I think the director was a watchdog over this Correctional project and I think they were bothered by this because they couldn’t steal a penny from this project. *** couldn’t stand the fact that she can’t steal a penny from Correctional. I don't know. It’s hard for me to believe that she is the head of this operation, now I’m telling you my own impression,  because I don’t see *** as an intelligent enough person to lead such an operation  if you understand what I mean.  But that’s just my point of view, I don’t know.  From a therapist’s point of view, I think *** is unstable, oscillates a lot,  she wants to do something, then she doesn’t. Does director Chiș have a history of losing his temper? No. Why do you say then that the victim can negotiate for you all, you say: \" you negotiate for us all so that this doesn’t happen again\"? Hm... I mean… to be honest and... To see if we can find a way through which we can work together... Yes? And to not waste our time with... I don't know... with chitchat, with rumors, with… I don't know… But you say \"so that this doesn’t happen again\".  What do you mean by \"so this doesn't happen again\"? So that she doesn’t end up in a situation where she would consider herself a victim  or consider herself harassed in any way… I still don’t know the truth. In the recordings we have, you also say:  \"If I managed to put myself under the safety net of a public institution, I don’t care about your personal conflicts.\" That’s not true, this is not true. You didn’t say that? I don’t talk like that. No, no way. The talks continue between the victim and the director. Now, Angela is no longer here, and you know what happened in your office on Thursday.  And you know…I don’t know, how you would react if…  your wife called you and told you that her boss strangled her. Please, I don’t want to go there, ok? Please be smart. I have a lot more life experience and I’m really scared of this war. I told you, peace is above justice, way above. But you started this, not me. Whoever started it, let’s end this.  And everybody knows. Everyone.  There are colleagues telling the prisoners about this as well. Why does it have to be so much pressure on me? Why did you not think about this before doing what you did? Before putting your hands up my throat... Stop living in the past, please. But I can’t forget, I cannot forget.  Stop thinking about the past because it will overwhelm you and it will destroy your future, please, think about the present. It honestly feels like you are trying to manipulate me right now.  No… Jesus Christ! Why are you saying this? Because when I told you for the past two years that I want peace, you didn’t want to… All this week I’ve been praying both in the morning and at night at Virgin Mary’s picture from the Turnu Monastery from Stânișoara. All week I’ve been praying and crying,  I rarely pray with such tears.  I kept saying: \"Mary, please make it right!\"  And I think this could also be a good thing, even if it is, actually, terrible. Because it can completely separate the personal side, which doesn’t exist anymore and will no longer exist.  And it can give us a new chance to act in a normal, professional way.  And our relationship will be amazing if we make peace. You said this so many times, so many times… But these weren’t the circumstances, it wasn’t this close to a disaster,  and I can tell what disaster is coming.  I could be in the position to lose my family because of this… The victim claims that the physical aggression was preceded by a long period of emotional abuse and tensions that exceeded the limits of the professional relationship between her and the director Horia Chiş.  For more than a year, the woman had allegedly been the victim of sexual and moral harassment at work.  Because she allegedly refused her boss's advances, she was repeatedly insulted, threatened with losing her job, and forced to leave the workplace during working hours, without any explanation. I told you so many times to…  come to work and each mind its business... But you didn’t communicate this well. Did you ever come to tell me \"Look, sir, I can’t do this anymore, let's do something about this.\" I told you, I told you I can’t stand this situation anymore… To find a solution… I couldn’t have this talk with you back then, because I tried, but you didn’t react like this. And is it not better later rather than never?  You know, I’m like this because I know what’s next.  And I don’t want to go through such a thing. There were times when you threatened me daily.  You know this.  I came to you, and I told you:  \"I don’t want anything to happen from now on.\" Yes? I tried to... I thought that would fix it and I can mind my business after. I also tried but didn’t succeed. Yes, but that’s what’s bothering me.  Why did it have to get so far, why did I have to go through this in order for things to get better?  If this wouldn’t have happened…. Ok, do you want this to go on? I would have been in the same… Do you want this to go on? I don’t want it to go on. This happened so that it will all be over.  It’s all over.  And it will never happen again.  This bang, this turmoil happened because it had to end this damn thing.  Maybe it had to happen for me.  And for me, it's over.   This is a fantastic opportunity for us, and it is the last one.  The fact that you made this all public…  All my feelings are gone, this whole sentimental side is gone. I need to keep my family. For me, this is the most important thing. When I told you this before  that it’s not ok because you have a wife and a child, you told me I shouldn’t dare mention something about them. Or think about them because it’s not my business. Yes, because I felt you were trying to provoke me and that you don’t mean it. No, I always tried to explain and you never…. You literally didn’t understand.  You didn’t want to listen to me and every time your reaction was very ugly. I feel I have been pushed around too much.  I told you, no one beat me up before, not even my parents. No, but I didn’t beat you up. That’s not a beating. No, you just put your hands around my throat.  If I put my hand around someone’s throat, ***…  The ambulance is needed. The director's pressures continued even after this discussion.  Because the victim refused to accept the cover-up of the case, Horia Chiş threatened her, a few days later, with the publication of some personal videos taken from her work laptop.  The video was shot by her partner, during their free time. Hello. Hello. I wanted to tell you…  Don't forget what you left on your work laptop. What did I leave there? What? What did I leave? Some personal photos.  No, you left more. What? Well, look. Go home and look.  Think about what's there and  if the two people who want to hurt me have any credibility. What? Again, I don’t want to hurt anyone,  but you will challenge me, like you always have, to do a lot of harm. Hello... Hello, my name is Alina Păduraru, I’m calling you from Recorder.  From the Recorder news publication. Hello. Yes. According to our information, you allegedly assaulted an employee of the Baia Mare Penitentiary. That’s not true, ma’am… not at all. It’s completely fake information. We have a recording where you tell the victim: \"this is not a beating, If I put my hand around someone’s throat, ***… the ambulance is needed.\" When you say that… Ma’am, I don’t know what sort of recording you have… Maybe it’s not the… Maybe it’s not my voice, not me talking, I don’t know what conversation you have. I had a lot of conversations with all my employees. I’m not an aggressor.  In the 20 years of my career, I was never suspected of any type of assault on any colleague. Not even a prisoner. Because I trust people a lot,  I’m very supportive  and I sacrifice myself for them because that’s what being the leader of a prison means. Even the Holy Scripture says, \"If you want to be the greatest, then live as one called to serve others\". The same victim accuses you of reacting aggressively after a period of emotional and even sexual harassment.  Oh my God! This is… Bullshit and I will appeal to justice. In the same recording you say the following thing:  \"All my feelings are gone, this whole sentimental side is gone.\" What type of relationship did you have with this employee if you felt the need to say: \"all my feelings are gone\"? Ma’am, all my relationships are strictly professional,  I’m a man who is very close to his colleagues and I believe in comradery. But why do you think you ended up here? Why do you think these accusations appeared? Because we, at the penitentiary, are working on a big strategic project  where… the lady you’re talking about has been having a miserable performance. And, from a professional point of view, I am very strict and serious. After this event, you went to the victim and threatened her that you will publish a personal video that you got out of her laptop. No, that’s not true, another rotten lie. Another absolutely rotten lie! We have a recording with you saying that. If you have a recording… I just want to say this: Anything that will be said about me publicly, or journalistically  will be taken to a court of law. The victim filed a police complaint against the director Horia Chiș. The investigation is ongoing.  She also signaled the case to the Director-General of the National Penitentiary Administration (NAP), the institution Horia Chiș is subordinated to.  NAP is currently investigating the case at the Baia Mare Penitentiary. Director Horia Chiș and the psychologist Angela Kozma continue their activity at the Baia Mare Penitentiary.  Despite the threats, the victim continues working there and is committed to fighting the injustices within the institution."}

foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is [Music] um disability um [Music] i'll take care [Music] salute foreign [Music] it's a house that is only on the first floor and it's like a holiday house for them they will provide the things when they come food and yeah okay it's good for them some of them understand english [Music] another foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] good and odessa i can't back to home because it's too dangerous i have a friend in cave he said he's bro every day i just want to have a normal wife i don't want to go in europe [Music] foreign [Music] uh the day when i left it was eighth of march and it was a woman day and some so years they came to the train station for women and celebrate us they tell something like i kiss you all everything will be okay and it was like something uh at the same time said and nice [Music] a part of my life it is work and they're part of my life it is sports i loved my life and of course i would like to get it again but i know it's impossible [Music] when i came to romania i was not scared we arrived at night i think it was about 1am we was tired and we met irina who helped us to go to her house and stay there for night i was at home for a week or more and it's really boring and you're in stress you want to get your normal life and work it's a very big part of your life irina told me she will ask some friends and maybe we will find something and when she told me i have this girl with whom you can work and on the next day we met and we decide work together [Music] when i came to romania i had dubs like i didn't have this goal to stay here for a long time but when i met these people and everyone tried to help you everyone tried to do something for you and you see this i didn't expect i didn't expect that i can find friends so so fast what is your plan what do you plan for now i just try to to stay here try to start my life again what are your plans for your kid i think he should continue his education i talked to this woman teacher from ukraine and she told me they tried to find the way how to do it they work on this [Music] [Music] odessa and i'm currently teaching ukrainian refugee kids here in bucharest [Music] nobody believed in a full-scale war but then we woke up at 5 00 am in odessa and we heard bombing and and first we thought we thought it was uh salwood or something but then we heard it again and we packed our things and our sun and uh we left outside the city we have a house there so we stayed there for two days and it was we thought that we will stay there for for some time but then uh the bomb fell across the street in the middle of the village so we packed our things and we went to the border of moldova so we stayed in the church there and when we slept in that church i saw a lot of children and of course with the loose terrified mothers and grandmothers the children were completely abandoned not understanding uh what was going on sitting in their tablets or or just not doing anything and they saw that it's a disaster and in long-term perspective what we're losing is first of all their childhood but but second of all is their brain this is the treasure of our nation our children if it takes too too long we need to educate them and then we came here and decided to help people uh to to leave odessa so we paid for two buses and we located 40 mothers with children and some of our teachers so we had we brought seven teachers here we decided to start not school but a small project and we basically the first step we took was we came to gara de norte and we i actually yelled at the station that we are teachers we we want to teach we need to teach help us to find place and then there was a chapel waiting for a train and he said okay look the major wrote something about the center for ukrainian kids go there stop being here and scaring people so we started a school with four children next day there were 12 day 3 there were 46 and it was a collapse for that center we didn't expect 46 children um so we understood that we need space but at that point i already knew the strategy you just have to shout and somebody will hear and that's what i did and we found the contact of somebody from the ministry of education and the very same day he found the contact of a college and the next day i came here and we said okay probably there will be 80 children on monday and then on sunday i text them okay we have 227. [Music] this is our first day we are from odessa this is my husband's military he stayed my also in odessa we come from kiev i think that it's a more normal life for her to go to school than to sit at home with me this moment the most important that our children that are refugees in ukraine and they passed many days underground without light without you know because we escaped from here it was a complicated situation there and they passed many days without contact without normal life and so here is the chance for them to have a normal life [Music] a lot more schools are willing to provide space with the best the best picture for me is that if we have to stay here and start a new school year in september then the ideal situation would be to be able to organize a ukrainian school which also should be free which is impossible without the help of the government [Music] this war is not going to last forever we will be able to come back at some point i'm sure it's still it has been a month since the war has started i think it's the scariest thing with the kids the children they're just what they they know they all they all want to kill putin and to kill russians and yesterday they fought because somebody called one of them russian so like he called me russian i'm not russian and they say and they had a fight but it's not it's not right and the children here some of them are from odessa and they're fine but some of them are for bucha european marijuana kiev and they don't have a home and their fathers are there it is also really hard that is why it's so important to give them routine because this this child view of this situation is just they can't understand everything and they think they're saying like they're fine now so but when you see a child smiling and say that you know i spent two weeks in the basement and even if a miracle happens and we and we're coming back tomorrow ukraine is destroyed so many cities or cities are just vanished the economy is destroyed so every life is broken every single life here is broken and there is no plan and nobody sees how it can end you just stop feeling that much you know you just you just get the news and you get things going you know okay this is what i have to do to help [Music] it is my form of resistance because to be fair i really don't want our children to go to school all over europe i don't want them to assimilate i want them to come back i want i want to grow competitive ukrainians and we need to teach them i really believe the situation russia is is in right now it's because they they've been educating their people to not have critical thinking to not question information and this is the disaster they got now and that's why ukraine is so so strong now because we resist we're fighting for our freedom [Music] we lived happy lives we were normal people with our small problems just like here we realized that this day is a great present we have roof we have food we have a place where we're invaded and we're welcomed and tomorrow can be much worse i think people can survive everything [Applause] [Music] days [Music] [Music] you"}

The martial law in Ukraine does not allow men between 18-60 years old to leave their country, so most of those crossing the border with Romania are women and children. Men move back! Men move back! You don’t understand or what?  I suggest you wait here. Here there’s food, water, toilet. Do you understand?  Thank you. Siret Customs,\nSuceava County, Romania Tens of Romanian volunteers mobilised their efforts to offer food, accommodation and transport to the refugees who enter Romania  Give them sweets.  Pampers? Wet tissues? Give them two. Disinfectant? Who has a phone SIM card for…?  Here is a SIM card, with internet. You can use it.  I understand, thank you.  Insert the SIM and you can use it. You have internet and minutes for calls  Potatoes from Bucovina! Potatoes from Bucovina! There you go sir. Thank you! Thank you!  To Iași – all of them.  We'll take you by car and provide accommodation.  If they want to leave Iași, they can stay for two, three days to rest a bit and then they can continue their travel.  This won’t work. They need to get to Czech Republic in 24 hours. In 24 hours... It's quite difficult to get there in 24 hours.  We can help you somehow, with a bus or something, but that will be only tomorrow. Tonight you will need to sleep somewhere. If you need a place to sleep, we can find one for free.  So you can rest tonight and then tomorrow you will find a way to leave. This is a situation no one wants to find himself in. It doesn’t matter if we have to work tomorrow, it’s already quite late and we have to get back. The most important thing right now is to support each other.  I cry because there are people in the middle, regardless of the political situation,  regardless of the political conflicts, or if they don't agree with history and they want revenge. At the end of the day, throughout history there were other people involved, not these ones.  I cry because it hurts. I could have been in their place. We could have been in their shoes. Is there something to heat the water?  On Friday night, the Prime Minister Nicolae Ciucă arrived at Siret Customs where he was met by furious volunteers. Since yesterday morning... Please look around how many people are here. Regular people, NGOs… The government should have been here! You should have been here to install tents and the volunteers to help.  But what did you do? If you walk around, you can see chaos. That’s because we did it on our own. This is not how things should be.  You came now a bit... Listen, it is easy to blame now. I do not blame anyone. I just state the reality.  And if you do it, I am sure you do it with the right intentions, ok? I have the right intention. We all have the right intentions here. Because we acted before the government did, before our leaders. That's the way it should be. No, this is not the right way.  Our government and the ones who lead us should have been here before us. After the Prime Minister left, volunteers continued to assist the refugees instead of the government that doesn’t seem to have a coherent plan so far.  Three children. One child. Two children. For how long have you been here? For about two hours. What was the most impressing thing you saw? Children being dragged like suitcases... Their sadness. The fact that some children are so affected by the war, that they do not want anything.  On my last drive, I took three kids and a mum. The little ones didn’t understand what was happening, but the older brother... The older brother was aware, and he was a bit devastated.  I am impressed by the fact that Romanians are so welcoming.  Look, here are some Romanians who brought bread. You know? I don’t know... It's very moving what's happenieng here. You made some tea at home?  Yes, I made 200 litres of tea at home, bought some bottles… And I hand it out to people. What type of tea? A tea made from different plants, with lemon and honey. Tea! Come on, take it. You don’t want it? You don’t like it?  The last thing you grab when being in exile is a toy for your child.  It's the last thing.  If you want to grab something, the jewelleries, the TV – anything  but a toy is the last on the priorities list. And imagine the joy of a child when he sees these toys. You know?"}

Industria care a transformat un oraș", "published_at": "2022-01-19T09:10:28Z", "description": "La începutul anilor 2000, într-un oraș cenușiu cu bănci vopsite în tricolor, câțiva antreprenori se încăpățânau să creadă în potențialul unui domeniu aproape necunoscut în România. Așa au apărut primele firme de IT din Cluj-Napoca. În prezent, aici sunt peste 1.400 de companii de profil, iar Cluj-Napoca a devenit orașul european cu cea mai mare creștere economică din ultimii 20 de ani. Am încercat să înțelegem povestea acestei transformări.\n---\nMaterial realizat cu sprijinul ING Tech", "transcript": "Avram Iancu International Airport, Cluj-Napoca How's the traffic at this hour? Cool! Heavy... Everybody comes to Cluj. Don't come to Cluj anymore, it's full! All the spots are taken, it's expensive. Don't come to Cluj anymore. Look here... It's 9:30 AM, right? Look, here! The past five years. This is the best building! Look how it took over the sidewalk. Look the way they're building in the back. Buildings, buildings, buildings, buildings! Like 2800 euro per square meter. And here is the poverty. Here are the ordinary people of Cluj. Grey Cluj. This is... the real Cluj, you know? Are there many people that came from other cities? I mean you feel that they are not... I say they are 90%... Do you know how Cluj is? It's like America after the war. It imports intelligence. Here, at this bridge, Cluj used to end. 3 years ago. Look what IT created! Cluj-Napoca 320.000 inhabitants\nCluj-Napoca 1.400 IT firms 20.000 IT employees 1 billion euros\nThe value of the local IT market Cluj exploded around the IT industry. Probably... 60, maybe 70.000 people owe their success to the IT industry. There is a really, really strong\necosystem of IT companies small, medium, and large. Which does not really exist\nin other cities. And when this snowball is rolling it gets bigger. It was also the will of some people\nto start businesses here, locally and they started to work. And they slowly kept growing, kept growing. It was like a snowball that kept getting bigger. The IT and the people of Cluj The industry that transformed a city IT, IT! Also in the back! And that, and the other building, over there... Everywhere is IT. Since when were they built? In the last five years. There, there... Here will be built another large building\nin front, by Bosch. I think there is a really important reason why Cluj exploded in terms of development. You probably remember the times when Funar was the mayor of Cluj... What happened in Cluj? Not many foreign companies came. A team of charlatans came, from Coca-Cola. I told them that I... don't negotiate or sign anything with\nthe scammers, the thieves, the bandits. And I asked them to leave. And that's why... here practically appeared a... sort of... \"Wild west\" where many\nRomanian companies have developed. But it was very difficult back then\nto convince anyone that they can wholeheartedly come  to Romania. What determined me to choose Cluj was that there was a Cluj-Frankfurt flight. And it was really important for me to have the chance to say to my clients that they can get to Cluj in an hour,\nan hour and a half. The first ones were asking: \"Can we go out in the evening?\nIsn't it dangerous to go out?\" The city was like after a bombing. The asphalt was full of pits... I know that in the spring, after the winter it was a disaster. I knew a client was coming, and I was embarrassed by how\nthe streets looked like. We had like three huge \"craters\"\nright in front of the company, so... I was thinking: \"If they come now they will see\nthose right in front of the building...\" And we talked to some colleagues from the company\nand I said: \"This weekend buy some cement, some ballast and let's cover them up ourselves. So the holes aren't so big.\" And I remember we fixed them and they looked somewhat decent. It was... like we were from another world. The first ten employees I recruited them or \"I stole them\" from the county library, from the hospital, from the county council... There were some IT employees there and... Really interesting, a story: In the first months, I would go\nto the company on Saturday and I found the office full of people. We had people, all very young... And I asked: What are these people doing here\nat the office on Saturday? They have no work to do, we're just starting now... Trainings... What are they doing at work? Someone, a little embarrassed told me: \"Do you know why they come? Cause there is air conditioning... we have Cola and Fanta... and we have internet\". We were very poor. Cluj was a bit of a closed city. I think it was one of the last big cities to have a mall. It was a romantic era. \"Transylvania\" business center based in Cluj-Napoca is the first Romanian organization\nintegrated into European institutions, all fundings come from the Council of Europe... We were also seen as weirdos. They said: \"He's a computer scientist!\" \"You have to be understanding\" Meaning: \"He is trapped in his own mind\". It was a very strange understanding\nof what it means to be a computer scientist or to study computer science. I had neighbors calling me to fix their TVs or fix some problems with their phones because I finished computer science. After the years 2000-2001 that's when it was like an explosion. Several relatively small companies have started to appear. And they slowly kept growing, kept growing. The first AROBS office was an apartment. And I'm convinced, and I've heard\nthat many other companies were working from apartments. Here, on the 1st floor... was the first office of AROBS company, There, at that balcony... At that balcony, exactly! Right there and I always remember it with... great pleasure and with... with a very good vibe when I pass by here. It was a very cool thing to do. We would all be sitting in one room, it was that sort of culture that even now I would like to have in the company where we would all help each other. Support each other... A lot of times, long after I had founded the company I was asked: \"But why didn’t you stay in the Sates?\" First of all, I’m from Cluj. It’s as easy as that. I had been in the US with the Work and Travel Program I even had an Interview with Microsoft but, due to family reasons I decided to come back. I was very reluctant and generally, received disapproval from the people around. \"‘Look at this guy that comes back from America, instead of staying there... and he’s coming back to Romania Poor guy, he’s a loser\". I’ll admit that I didn’t reinvent the wheel I only did... what I saw was already working somewhere else. How many projects are currently being developed at AROBS? I think we are talking about hundreds. Mostly the auto industry, the travel industry, pharma industry... Fin-tech... So we have many areas in which we develop our products. We have a flexible workspace. Firstly, taking into account the pandemic, where people want the option to work from home. Wave to the camera! Here we are developing software for electrical heaters, for cars. For the batteries and the inside. We are testing a product that will pre-heat the car's engine. For example, during winter we can turn on the car's engine before we get in. Remotely, we can set the temperature so that when we get in the car, it would be already warm. Using the phone or how? Yes, from the smartphone. Here we work for the auto industry Car Cockpit, all sorts of systems... that we develop. There are safety systems, braking systems... My colleagues are working especially for automotive clients. So, when you buy a BMW or a Porsche, for example, you should know that a part of the software... Yes. A part was also made here... Yes, exactly. A part of the software is made here, exactly. This software is developed here, in Romania, and... There is also software developed fully in Germany. So effectively, it is done half and half. Everyone imagines that IT means only coding, writing a code. It is a bit more than that. You can invent something completely new, that does not exist yet, or you can find new solutions, from your everyday life, that are profoundly innovative. There is this statement that nowadays we only outsource. But that outsourcing is extraordinarily complex in comparison to developing a new app, for someone, and you build the app. We develop in one of those grand projects, tens, maybe hundreds of smaller apps. It is way more complex to understand one of these ‘monster’ projects that are running over the course of a couple of years and to make them functional, than to make a few apps. What is very good is that this expansion of Cluj is happening in a field that has a future. The number one factor here is that there are universities. When you have universities, you have students, and automatically IT Companies, automatically there will be investors and projects will appear. There were about 100 computer science graduates, at our university, at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, now there are about 700 in a year. This year we had 1500 candidates. So about three on one spot. The motivation behind most of the students is that they will earn a lot of money. And there is... A big discrepancy between the entry-level income that a computer science graduate earns which is somewhere around 4000 RON, 3500-4000 RON, and which is two-three times bigger than the income of their own parents. I think the standard of living for a programmer here, is comparable to any other programmers from Europe. Meaning, 3.000-4.000 euros is an amount that is certainly within reach after some years of experience. When you earn a comfortable salary, in a city that starts to offer cool social and cultural events, that starts being a cool city, having restaurants, and everything you would need,  you no longer want to leave. Good evening, Cluj! Come in, come in! This is your backyard, right? Don't know if I should call it a backyard or the office... Or both. Yes... please make yourself comfortable. I lived in London for 10 years. Then came back to Cluj. Yes, it's ok! Honestly, comparing it to other big cities where life gets really crazy, and practically it’s a constant race... It’s a race, after a race, after a race. Here, at least you can have a small yard, where you can chill, you have friends... I moved to London in 2011. And I stayed there until 2018. Afterward, I switched back to Cluj in 2018. Every time I came back, I noticed changes. And I was thinking: \"Damn!\", you know? Especially in the last years, I felt growth and I think this was also the reason I stayed. Nowadays, what sort of income can a programmer with your experience have? It depends, I think that in management you can earn over 10.000 euros. Yes. A month? Monthly, monthly. In Cluj... My ideal situation is to not be an employee in a corporation, or in a multinational, as they can be pretty strict and I like a bit of flexibility. Because of the flexibility, I can go and work from wherever I want from Spain, from Asia, ...look here! Brooklyn Bridge. The Laptop ...the coffee. This is in the World Trade Center. This is, for example, a project written in JavaScript. I don’t want to get into details, but practically this is a small project that we work on with some friends from the UK, which to my surprise started having huge traction. It had about 200 and something thousand users. Afterward, we got a pretty substantial funding and now we carry-on. And can someone make a living only out of projects like this? Absolutely! Absolutely, that’s why I was saying that I sincerely prefer it so because I have options. I chose which type of projects I want, when I work, what I work. Whereas, if I would work for an agency, be it outsourcing, or like a corporation, I would have little flexibility, you know? Guys, I must head towards the city and meet some friends. They are also from the tech zone. Would you like to join me? How is it going, man? Getting fat and bold. I graduated from the Computer Science Highschool. But back then I couldn't understand what I could do as a computer scientist. There was no marketing or advertisement on what you could do in this domain. I think half of my class didn’t work in IT. But they ended-up in any case, like me, after 10, 20 years, in IT. I remember that the IT community back then was somehow very cool. You know? These were the days when electronic music was becoming popular in Romania and, generally, it started appearing mostly in these geek circles. So it was also about the lifestyle? Yes. It was not only... my passion for... During those times, we had DC ++. We had access to download music and... not only that. Yes, and I think that afterward a sort of bubble appeared or some sort of talent influx on the market and there were many people that took advantage of it and the market started to grow on its own. The initial growth was very much due to those pioneers that started in ’97-’98. Why? Because they formed some small circles and immediately afterward, from a business point of view, there was a lot of opportunities and they had to grow and grow, and to attract new people. Is Cluj the best place where you can live and grow...? Yes, I would say that it is a good place. I am not sure it's a necessarily perfect one. The term itself is relative. Even Silicon Valley isn’t perfect. Everyone says ‘Cluj is the Silicon Valley of Romania’ ... Is that PR or reality? PR. PR! PR! A lot of PR! The best PR. Why? We are good at this as well. Because Silicon Valley means products. Exactly. And we do services. We are the ...’Mumbai of Romania’ Good morning! Hello! How is it going? I am Andrei, nice to meet you! Georgiana, nice to meet you! Welcome! To AirportLabs. Mainly, we create products, solutions that optimize critical operations from airports, and we are working with very big airports like Dubai or with the biggest airports from the UK. Here is Heathrow airport and the data is also about the airlines, the percentages of on-time departures. Here are the planes that move in real-time in Dubai airport. If I click on this plane I can see that it is just about to take off. I see from which lane he left, where it is going, what its flight number is. This is a space managing system. It helps you see in real-time the space occupancy rate. This sensor is basically created by us. How do you explain that this idea was born in Cluj? And not in Bucharest, for example? Well, let’s ask Ligiu Uiorean, the one that founded this company, he is from Cluj. Ligiu is waving at us, he is in a meeting. Occupation: Automation Engineer, Company: AirportLabs, Founded: 2015, Turnover: 3 mil EUR, Average Nr of Employees: 50 I had no idea that it would be so successful, but I have saved some money, that I was prepared to lose in order to try something that had good chances to succeed. I am from Cluj and... and I don’t really believe the place matters but rather the people. We are not lacking in ideas, we are lacking in the courage to try something on the long run. If you want to make a product it is very, very difficult. Do you like how Cluj developed, around the IT business? I mean, the city itself? No... No, I find it very toxic. I find it toxic so no... What is happening in Cluj... is harmful to society. To have a class of people that earn much, much more than other working classes, it is known to be toxic. By chance, this is the IT industry, but even if we talk about another industry, it would be just as toxic. Is IT responsible for the urban development of recent years? I think it is. It is clear that through their incomes, they have changed the market a bit. There is pressure on rents. And obviously, the entry-level salary is getting bigger and bigger. There are areas in which the apartments are selling even at 4000 euros per square meter, which is extremely expensive. It is an expensive city. Apartment price evolution in Cluj-Napoca (EUR/ sqm) A lot of crowded projects were born. Apartment buildings next to houses... The prices went up a lot. Who was living in Cluj, in the city center, ten years ago, most likely, nowadays would probably not afford to live in the city center. Do you agree with the way the city is developing? I think that in the real estate business I would hope for a bit more laws and a bit more... People should have something more to say in it and the mayor should listen, I think that that would be important. The infrastructure.. is lacking. Very chaotic! I pay rent so... How much is the rent in your area? 350-400 euros. That's a lot... It seems to me a lot as well... How many rooms do you have? Two rooms. I mean, we are not computer scientists. I am not working in IT. For me to reach the income of an IT employee, will take some time. Two jobs ... We are not from the city... We are just working here, but we are not living here. We are from the countryside. We haven’t been into the City, only here! We work here, we know our way here... We see the people... Anything else... We don't know... We do not know the city life, because... We don't live in the city. In Salaj no one does what they do in Cluj. We are coming from there to earn our living here. Otherwise... Hello! Hello! You must be Andrei! Andrei! Andrei! Bob...Bob Radulescu! I am born in Cluj. Born and raised in Cluj, in one of its neighborhoods. And I saw somehow the evolution of the city as I was never away for a long period of time. Everyone knows, we are 30 years after the Revolution and we are the city of the two mayors. We had Ghita Funar for an eternity, and then we had Mr. Boc for another eternity. Beyond public administration, people are the ones that have actually changed the city. So the people that you are drinking coffee with in the Muzeului Square, one of them is a developer, a programmer that builds a software which everyone benefits from. That's cool. It's very cool. That person needs to live somewhere, he wants to buy an apartment, and if he made a ton of money, probably he didn’t want to live in a 30 square meters studio. So he said: \"Make a 100 square meters apartment for me because I can afford it\". And the real estate developer said: \"There is room for development\". There are a lot of young people coming that can afford to pay 3000 euros per square meter. It is not insanity! It's beyond insanity! The income is not in all areas the same. Ok, the IT industry is doing well. They can afford it. They do not have enough people! They have money to offer and they do not find people. The retirees and people that... the 300.000 inhabitants that have built the city in the last 50 years, they are now retired. No one can take sides, I wouldn’t dare to take anyone’s side but I know that if tomorrow the IT Industry, the big companies, the multinationals would close down everything and we would look at one another in distress, \"Now what?\" Beyond my job as an actor, I earn my existence from all the events, courses and trainings. Any company that wishes to reach people is contracting us, the people of Cluj. For me, this is a godsend. But I am also the one that says, sometimes upset, Dude, it is a bit too much! If you encounter an angry citizen from Cluj, he will tell you about ‘vinituri’. What is that? ‘Viniturile’? You are in the heavy traffic and you see that the car does not have Cluj plates You were already pissed... \"These people again, the newcomers, they take our space!\" We are like the Parisians, the old ones, sitting in windows facings Champs-Elysees and screaming: Putain de merde! You invaded Paris! This is an area that the locals know very well, we are at the foot of the Cetatuia hill. If you want, we can take a walk up there, from where we have a nice view. Cetatuia is a place... every loved by the locals. I remember it since I was young. Everything that you see on the horizon, either new buildings or even new neighbourhoods, built next to public institutions. Commercial Centres, Malls, neighborhoods. Have a look along that line, when we were children, you could only see the hills. Right over there, at the end above there. Now there are hundreds of houses and there are people that commute everyday, just as the people living around Bucharest and Ilfov do. Now I live, exactly on the stripe of land from where even more than 25 years ago, I used to pick apples from when I was little. And I used to enjoy the sight of Cluj in the evening from it. I used to think: ‘It would be so nice to live in nature... to live here and to have Cluj at your feet\". Today I live on the same stripe of land from which 25 years ago, I used to pick apples. The question is when does it stop? Or where does it stop? I don’t think it will stop? You can’t stop it. It would be hypocritical of me to say that I live badly from this. No, I live well. Ok? But... it will hurt us. I am not sure if it will hurt in three months, six months, or six years. There is no long-term planning and this is very problematic. Yes, I think there are negative sides to everything. But, as they say, \"you need to break some eggs in order to make an omelet\". Maybe this... is rather the direction. Let’s evolve as fast as possible, let’s grow. Yes, there will be... some unhappy people, but at the end of the day, as a community and as a city we all have something to gain."}

A RECORDER JOURNALIST INFILTRATED\nTHE CHURCH'S FINANCIAL NETWORK - Should I kiss their hands?\n- No, just say hello. - Hello!\n- Welcome! - It's nice to be here!\n- Come in! - You’re beside the Great White...\n- The Great White? Is that what you call him? A NETWORK THAT SECRETLY RIGS TENDER\nPROCESSES WORTH MILLIONS OF EUROS Leave your phones in there. How can we be sure we'll win\na tender process or two? - The proposal's used for a tender process.\n- Okay. - And it's won by whoever did the proposal...\n- Yes. The specification goes to the firms named\nby you or me, I'll name a couple too. A SYSTEM WHERE ONLY THE CHURCH’S\nANOINTED FIRMS PROSPER - Hi!\n- Morning! - Are these churches?\n- Yes, each one's a contract. - Holy moly! They're all contracts?\n- Yeah, mate... A SYSTEM HIDDEN BY THE CHURCH\nAND ENDORSED BY ITS LEADER If our Patriarch's a very good manager,\npeople'll say he only cares about money. What's he supposed to do? In terms of funds, the\nRomanian Orthodox Church is very poor. We’ll draw up a document\ninforming His Beatitude. And if we hold this meeting and get\nhis approval, we'll be fine... I asked the Great White,\nthat’s how it is... It’s true he was in the Securitate.\nHe knows more than anyone. THE CLAN OF THE \"GREAT WHITE\"\nA Recorder investigation Recorder recently published\na probe into the deals behind the People’s Salvation Cathedral, Romania’s grandest building\nproject in 30 years. The Church oversaw the project\nbut relied heavily on public money. Save your people, Lord! The state gave the Church\n11 hectares in central Bucharest with a market value of\nabout EUR 180 million. Then, over the last decade, the\ngovernment and local councils gave it an extra EUR 120 million\nfor the project. It spent the money non-transparently\nunder rules of its own making. Although it used public money, the Church\ncloaked the project in secrecy and refused to say which\nfirms had won contracts or what they were earning\nor charging for materials. Recorder has learned that\nthe winners of the contracts include politicians with\nclose ties to the Church. Adriean Videanu, a former deputy PM,\neconomy minister and mayor of Bucharest, made over RON 100 million through\nhis firm, which supplied marble. But despite its vast size, the\ncathedral is just a small part of the empire built by the Church\nunder Patriarch Daniel’s reign. On taking office in 2007, the Patriarch\nbemoaned the Church's financial situation. In terms of funds, the\nRomanian Orthodox Church is very poor. In terms of the immediate\nreturn we get on money, it's very poor compared\nwith what it should get. Since then, the Church has\nseen a major overhaul that has boosted its assets considerably. In the last 12 years, the value of its properties\nhas risen by more than 80 times from RON 10 to 820 million. Its annual revenue has quadrupled\nto RON 112 million. The latest Ministry of Finance\nfigures show that Orthodox dioceses, archdioceses\nand metropolises bring in RON 590 million a year altogether. Then there are the revenues of the\nthousands of churches and monasteries, for which the state has no exact figures. The main reason for this\nunprecedented wealth is a new goal set by Patriarch Daniel: that the Church soaks up as much\npublic money as it can. This is being achieved through\na network of influence with political ties which is headed\nby the Patriarch himself. Our lord, Patriarch Daniel... He uses his position to win the support of high-ranking politicians\nfor Church projects. We give this decoration of the\nOrder of the Holy Brâncoveanu Martyrs for his future help, too. Beneath him are several tiers of people who run the system that\ndraws in public cash. First, there are Church figures\nwho report directly to him and liaise with public institutions\non the Church’s behalf. Then there are politicians and civil\nservants in parties and institutions who pull strings so that\npolitical leaders' promises to the Patriarch are kept. At the bottom are businessmen who pick up public money\nshared out by the Church: its “preferred suppliers”. We tried for months to find a way\ninto this watertight network so we could track the public money that all but disappears after\n entering the Church's coffers. Eventually, we found a way in. - Let’s go!\n- Hello! Petrescu! Lazăr Neacșu is serving a second term\nas a PSD Bucharest city councillor. Before getting into politics,\nhe owned construction firms that were hired by the Church. Sources had told us he was a Church \"fixer\" who pulled strings to extract\ncash from councils. As the Church never answers questions\nabout how it spends public money, we felt the only way to find\nout was to go undercover and talk to Church figures\nunder an assumed identity. I've not been here since\nthe revamp, it's great! - No?\n- No. These are our rooms. We contacted Neacșu under\nthe alias ‘Gabriel Petrescu’ and said we represented a consultancy\nwith ties to the political new wave. As councils had overlooked the Church\nwhen budgeting for this year, we told him we could make up\nfor this with EU funding. To make our cover story more plausible, our bogus businessman said\nthat he'd been put onto Neacșu by a councillor close to the mayor\nof Bucharest and was a member of USR PLUS, a party\nin government at the time. So ‘Gabriel Petrescu’ had council\nand government ties. All this was untrue, but it sounded good\nto an opposition politician in a position to broker\nbackroom deals at City Hall. So Neacșu didn't check out our story and invited ‘Gabriel Petrescu’\nto his council office. First, he gets us to leave our\nphones in another room. Leave your phones in there\nand we'll talk in here. Hello! - I take it this [ashtray] means I can smoke?\n- Yes. Mask off, as I'm jabbed. This is a smoking room where\nwe councillors lark about. Okay. Neacșu explains the legal process by which churches in Bucharest receive public funds and then stresses his own importance in it. All churches in capital cities,\nespecially in Europe, receive funds from local or city councils. Full stop. Every year, priests at all 259 churches and 10 monasteries across Bucharest ask the city council for help with\nvarious things as allowed by law. - X, Y, Z, okay...\n- Right. From that list of over 100 churches, a team is put together, it’s made up of... Aren’t agreements reached\nseparately with each...? That'd be a hassle. Then the Monuments Authority man\ncomes to the mayor and says: “We need to talk to someone at the\ncouncil to see who wants what…” I’m a member of the Church Assembly. - What?\n- Church Assembly. - What’s that?\n- The National Church Assembly. Neacșu explains to us in detail the make-up\nof this governing body of the Church. The Romanian Orthodox Church\nis run by 45 bishops... - I didn't know there were so many!\n- And 45 laypeople... - Okay.\n- Ordinary people who... - Like civilians.\n- Romania’s elite… Like parishioners. I'm there with the head\nof the Notaries Society, Ioan Aurel Pop, Noica, all of high society. - You only get in if you’re in the elite.\n- That rules me out! Or if you’ve done things for the\nChurch that distinguish you. We later unearthed TV footage attesting\nto Neacșu's own good deeds. In the village of Muntenii de Sus,\nwhich is over 300 years old, a church was built with the support of Lazăr Neacșu, a man\ndevoted to his birthplace. Neacșu has long been\nclose to the Patriarch. Five years ago, he rose to the highest\noffice a layman can reach in the Church: Member of the National Church Assembly, a kind of parliament presided over\nby the Patriarch that sits annually. Neacșu was parachuted into\npolitics by the Church. He told us he'd joined the PSD\nat the urging of Patriarch Daniel, who is nicknamed the \"Great White”\nwithin his network of influence. I’m a businessman,\nthings were slack in 2016. - I wasn't a politician originally.\n- Okay... I was a member of the National Assembly. I asked the Great White which party\nI should join to become a councillor. \"Join the PSD, it'll win by a landslide!\" - And it did, didn't it?\n- Seriously? Of course. He was in the Securitate. He knows more than anyone, like the Pope. In the 2016 local elections, Neacșu became\na PSD councillor in Bucharest. For the Church, a man in a\nposition like that is a godsend. Bucharest City Council has the biggest\nbudget of any Romanian local authority and votes on all funding requests\nfrom churches in the city. Neacșu votes in the Church’s favour\nand lobbies other councillors to vote grants through. 2016-2020 was a busy time for him. When Gabriela Firea was mayor,\nthe council gave the Church funding totalling nearly RON 200 million for the cathedral and churches\nacross the city. No one knows what the Church\ndoes with this money. To find out, we had to go higher up\nin the network, with Neacșu’s help. After we'd said we could secure EU funds for\nrenovations of \"historic monument\" churches, he introduced us to members\nof the Patriarch’s inner circle. Have you got access to EU funds? Yes, more than access. I’ll take you to the Archdiocese\nand talk to the EU funds boss. He'll tell you which churches\nare monuments. You can start on them directly. Plus they’ve got church halls,\nparish houses, priests’ houses… We can do the designs... A few days later, we meet Neacșu outside the Chancery\nof the Church's Holy Synod. - Didn't you see me here?\n- I wanted to have a word first. Hi! - I'll shut this...\n- Should I kiss their hands? - We never do that.\n- I'm being serious. - No, just say hello.\n- So I won't bother with... Hello! - I'm Father Aurel Mihai.\n- Hello! Gabi Petrescu. - Gabi?\n- Petrescu. Petrescu... Have a seat. You’re beside the Great White… The Great White? Is that what you call him? Can you come here? For European [funds]… Aurel Mihai is the suffragan bishop\nof the Archdiocese of Bucharest and one of the Patriarch’s deputies. He liaises between the Patriarch\nand public institutions. We're dealing here with one of the\nmost powerful men in the Church. You tell me what you do\nand I’ll tell you what I do. It's crowded in here.\nLet’s get to know each other. My role is to deal with authorities. I see. The council, councils. Suffragan Bishop Mihai seems very\ninterested in getting EU funds but insists that churches won't contribute. This is to get around the law\nand avoid co-financing. Can these funds be accessed without us involving\nthe parish financially? Let me ask my superiors about that. I was saying maybe we should settle\na payment notice. Yes, the co-financing. You can't. - But parishes can't, Vali.\n- But you can't... - His project's worth a million euros!\n- But co-financing's mandatory… Going and talking to the council later,\nthat's another matter. The message coming from the room is clear: the Church can only receive\nmoney, not spend it. Lazăr Neacșu immediately boasts that\nhe can arrange public co-financing. I’ll sort out the co-financing,\nor you two will, with funds from the district council or the city council or Opaschi\n[Secretary of State for Faiths]. So we've got three funding sources. Now you’ve got a man you can\nrely on to do something. And I can get 20%\nfrom the district councils. If I go to Piedone, I can sort out 20%. With the co-financing issue resolved,\nAurel Mihai stresses an important point: no Church deal can be sealed\nwithout an all-important blessing. After the next meeting, we’ll draw up\na document informing His Beatitude. And if we hold this meeting and get\nhis approval, we'll be fine... If our Patriarch's a very good manager,\npeople'll say he only cares about money. What's he supposed to do?\nHold services so money falls from heaven? No, he makes do with what he's got. The meeting ends on an optimistic note but with a reminder that\nthe Patriarch has the final say. - We'll get the blessing and meet...\n- We'll draw up a document. - So the blessing's the priority.\n- It is for us. Before leaving, we fix up another meeting to decide how the EU funds\nwill be divvied up. A FEW WEEKS LATER A few weeks later, we hire\na flash set of wheels because we’re off to Patriarchate Hill and we need to look like\nbig-league businessmen. Outside, we're met by\nLazăr Neacșu, our contact. - I funded this consolidation recently.\n- What, this? When I was on the Culture Committee. He means the Culture Committee\nat City Hall, which approves funding for churches and\nwas chaired by him from 2016 to 2020. He says all the recent renovations here were funded with public money he secured. - It's nice here.\n- Yes, I did it two years ago. I added this lift too. - Hello!\n- Welcome! - Thank you!\n- Come in! The engineer's the coordinating advisor in the\nMonuments and Church Buildings Division… With the introductions over,\nwe try to find out how the Church spends public money. Mircea Podoleanu, the Patriarch’s\ncoordinating advisor, explains. This is what I’d like to know.\nI’ll cut to the chase. We're only talking in principle anyway,\nplease speak your mind. Okay. How does it work when\nthe Church hires a contractor? Is it like state procurement?\nDon't you publish in SICAP or... No, we don’t publish in SICAP. If the value's over 100,000, for works,\nthere's a tender process. Okay. A specification is drawn up with measurements,\neligibility requirements, all the… A notice is put in the newspaper, Lumina. It has the biggest circulation\nof any paper in Romania. The Patriarch's advisor is saying that the Church doesn't use the\nstate procurement system. It does everything in house\nunder its own rules. This gives it a very free hand,\nand our sources told us that Church tender processes\nare always won by the intended winner. So we venture to ask the key question. How can we be sure we'll win\na tender process or two? Because we're not running a charity here. - For consultancy?\n- Yes. Well, it works like this. You bring us a package, okay? When we get His Beatitude’s approval, that’s worth more than any guarantee\nin Strasbourg, so don't worry. - Okay.\n- You see? Also, because I’m guilty\nof the sin of gluttony too, I'd like to ask: if we get the go-ahead, can we also take on part of the works as\nsubcontractors or intermediaries? Or... Bring your portfolio showing you’re\nup to the job and name the firms…. - Yes, I'm not talking SRL-Ds…\n- Come to Mr Podoleanu. He'll take it from there. He'll tell the Patriarch about you,\nyou'll get the blessing and then there won't be any changes. As the meeting ends, Neacșu\ntells the Church figures why it's a good idea to accept\nthe terms just outlined: because, as we told him, we're\na politically connected firm that gets hold of money and then asks\nto keep a cut, in time-honoured fashion. If you sign a consultancy contract with him,\nthe money's guaranteed. Like with the PDL and PSD firms. The contracts are guaranteed…\nwhich makes sense. The Church figures seem familiar with this\nset-up and are itching to get going. Before we leave, Aurel Mihai\nstresses one last point to us. To get things going, we'll have\nto keep on at them a bit because the system's a bit slow. Okay. We've got to say: there's money\nup for grabs here, let's get it. Are they reluctant, or what? It's not that. Well, because of\nthose past experiences. Also, the faster we move, the sooner\nHis Beatitude gives his blessing, let's beat the councils to it. We leave in shock after two hours of talks with two highly influential men\nin the Patriarch’s entourage about rigging EU-funded tender processes. Outside, what we heard is confirmed. Lazăr Neacșu catches up with us and explains\nhow the Church rigs tender processes. Let me explain... Lumina's a newspaper,\nit's their procurement system. So you need to know when to buy it. Only one paper comes out a day\nand no one buys it. You need to submit a list, A to Z. You say: \"I want these firms to\ndo the work for you.\" We give them to Podoleanu.\nHe publishes and okays them. How can I be sure no one\nelse will buy the paper…? No, you don't get it. The specification goes to the firms named\nby you or me, I'll name a couple too. - If I go to a newsstand and buy Lumina…\n- It's not on general sale! It only comes out in churches.\nDon’t you get it? You see? - I’m getting funny looks for smoking.\n- Take no notice. Lumina's not on general sale,\nit's only in churches. You see? And who goes to church\nto make money? No one. - What'll some old biddy do with that rag?\n- If she sees a tender notice… It’s no use to her. You misunderstood… - That’s what was worrying me…\n- I'll explain. You name 20 firms and say: I want them\nto work, I’ll finance them for you. Job done! - Whoa! That's fantastic!\n- Yes! A state within a state. - Great!\n- You see? We soon learn that the Church is\nunwilling to rig tender processes solely in favour of our chosen firms. It has its own stable of firms that\nwe'll have to share the cash with. The day after the meeting at Patriarchate Hill,\nwe get a missed call from Aurel Mihai. - Hello, Father!\n- Oh, Gabriel, may God give you health! I was just thinking of you. We're already working on that document\nto officialise the marriage. - Yes.\n- I've talked to a builder friend of mine and he'd like to meet you. - We can meet for a coffee.\n- About the same matter. - Can I give him your number?\n- By all means! - He's young, like you, educated, discreet...\n- By all means! Give him my number and I'll gladly\nhave a coffee with him. Fine. He has some goals that he… Yes?\nSo that things go well. - Yes. Great. Okay.\n- God bless! All the best! So for things to go well, we must\nwork with the Church's firms. We've reached the third\nlevel of the network through which the Church draws\nin and shares out public money. - Hello! Gabriel Petrescu?\n- Petrescu, yes. Who's this? - Marian Iorga. Bishop Aurel Mihai gave me your number.\n- Oh, hello! Yes, he mentioned you.\nSo we’re due to have a coffee. - When you're free...\n- How about tomorrow morning? - Nine's perfect.\n- Yes? Great. Thanks. See you then! - Thanks. Bye!\n- Bye! THE NEXT DAY - Hi!\n- Morning! We meet Iorga at his Bucharest office. Some water. I'm thirsty... - Still? Coffee?\n- Still. And a coffee. What's this? St Elijah, main façade. Is that going to be done?\nFor a priest? We've just designed it. And I’m repairing a centre.\nI submitted a tender today. Repairs... A project worth nearly EUR 1 million\nand repairs at a centre. But the project worth EUR 1 million\nis small beer in this office. These files are unfunded projects. - Are these churches?\n- Yes, each one's a contract. - Holy moly! They're all contracts?\n- Yeah, mate... How long have you worked\nwith these guys? Wow. These haven’t gone ahead. - The finished jobs aren't here…\n- Right. So these are contracts\nfor church restorations that Iorga got before funding\nwas in place for them. These are councils you’ve\nalready talked to? Why doesn’t the Monuments Authority give them\nany more? Or district councils... I submit everywhere,\nat district council halls and the Monuments Authority… So you do the legwork, not the priests. What could a priest do? Seriously? You see? I go and submit them everywhere. Wherever I get money, I work. As a businessman, Iorga has no\nauthority to submit documentation to councils and request public funding. But he does this on parishes' behalf\nbecause he's more than a contractor. He's a lynchpin in the network\nthrough which the Church wangles money from councils. Beneath this level made up of businessmen are rank-and-file priests whose only role\nis to keep their heads bowed and take orders from above. While we're in Iorga’s office,\nhe sees a priest who's awaiting funding for the\nrestoration of his church. - The priest's here.\n- Send him in. - In you come.\n- Hello! - Christ is risen!\n- He is risen indeed! I’m here as promised. At one o’clock. - Actually, I’m late, sorry. Four minutes.\n- That's okay. Father, I’ve been as much as\nfour days late… Have a seat. I forgive you now. - The priest from Oțetari with the monument...\n- Ah, okay. Hello. Yes, a monument dating to 1600. There’s an area behind the Intercontinental.\nWe want to do it. Okay. If it’s a monument, great.\nDo you want green energy? - To get off that smelly old gas?\n- Why not? - Yes?\n- Yes. - You can put it here.\n- Has the council money come through? - Yes.\n- Already? - Yes.\n- Roughly how much? I don't know. - About 700,000.\n- That’s not much. For now. Although his parish has\nreceived council funding, the priest from Oțetari is looking\nto Iorga for financing. Minutes later, the businessman gets off\nthe phone and gives him good news. - You might get more money from District 2.\n- Yes? They don’t want to give any to other churches.\nOnly centres and monuments. The council phoned me, they want\nto redistribute the rest of the money to centres and monuments, but... - In Mihaiu’s district?\n- Yes. But on Friday, when I talked to\nthe bishop and the city manager, he said it was okay with the bishop. I said if it’s okay with the bishop,\ncan we put in a couple? He said we'd talk on Monday. - But now it’s not okay with the bishop.\n- Aurel? Money sometimes comes\nto the less well off! To understand how priests come to be under\nthe thumb of construction firm bosses, let's look at how churches\nreceive public money. To get a grant, a church must\nsubmit a file of documents to the authorities to show\nit needs repairs. It must pay construction experts to carry out\nsurveys and draw up a renovation proposal. But because the Church's policy\nis not to spend its own money, its chosen firms are called\nin at this initial stage. They draw up a proposal\nand recoup their costs later. Then the tender process takes place\nas explained by Lazăr Neacșu: a notice in Lumina is read by the\nintended winner, who gets the job – usually the firm that wrote the proposal. The priest confirms that\nthis is how it works. A project proposal is drawn up.\nIt goes off to be approved. They check and okay it. Then the proposal's used for a tender\nprocess with a quote. And it's won by whoever\ndid the proposal... Yes, but it has to be okay\nbecause they use a program… We've had cock-ups in the past. - You didn't get what you said…\n- Yes. That's what I asked at the Archdiocese: how can we be sure of winning\n if we get hold of the money? Because we’re laying out the cash. Of course you’ll win.\nThat’s natural, right? I think… If it was up to me, I’d say:\n“Why don’t you just let the work start?” We faff around so much... “The guy’s okay. Let him get on with\nthe work. He’s got the cash…” Because otherwise you don’t\nget anything done… Give you a proposal? The church can’t\ndo that, it’s a specialist thing and it can't afford to contract it out. “Hey, Father, pay EUR 10,000.”\nHow can he? - I mean, realistically…\n- Yes. You can only get it from a builder who\ncovers the costs so priests don't have to. Usually, like I said,\nwhen I start on a job, I do it from scratch and cover\nthe costs till it's funded. When it’s funded, I tell the priest:\nthe proposal was EUR 10,000, the proposal must be paid for.\nThe funding covers it. Yes, not the poor box. But I don’t influence the job. If the job's\nEUR 100k and the proposal's EUR 10k, the work has to be EUR 90k. Yes, so there's no overlap. So it equals what you’re given… And, again, local councils\ncan’t fund the proposal. I include the proposal in the\nprice of the job, you see? - So it wasn’t a waste of time.\n- Yes. Because the designer will want payment. Iorga talks as if this is all above board,\nbut in fact, it’s a conflict of interest. The proposal explaining\nwhy the work is needed is drawn up by the firm\nthat will do the work. Iorga then pays for it out of the public\nfunds allocated for the work. This suggests the construction firm's boss\nis free to decide his costs and profit. This is a perk of working with the Church, the only entity that receives public money without any direct state oversight. Iorga opens the cupboard again. I'll show you an example. Let’s take one of these. Cașin. Have you worked at Cașin too? No, we've no funding there yet. What'll you do there? Repairs for RON 2 million. 10 plus 5. 15%. That’s your profit. In theory, profit's 5%,\nindirect costs are 10%. But you’ll never spend 10%\non indirect costs. I see, okay. To understand the terms used by Iorga, let’s take the example\nof a church renovation. Direct costs are all the actual\ncosts of the work, from materials to labour. The firm's profit is 5%\nof the total direct costs. But 10% of the direct costs is set aside for costs not directly\nrelated to the work. These can be admin costs,\naccounting and other services supporting the firm's activity\nand not the work per se. These are indirect costs,\nand as Iorga himself admits, they can never reach 10%\nof the cost of the work. - You play around with indirect costs.\n- You have to know... Lately, we’ve been doing 10 for\nindirect costs and 10 for profit. Uh-huh, okay. And your total net profit's 15%. - After the actual costs?\n- Yes. But there's also a hidden profit. Builders play around with not only\ntheir profit and indirect costs, but also the prices of materials and labour\nto push up the total job price. Chiajna Monastery is one of\nhundreds of renovation jobs funded with council money\nin Bucharest in recent years. The contract was won in 2018 by\nSolid System Solutions, one of Iorga’s firms. We obtained documents stating\nthe costs of this work and checked them with experts in the quote calculation software used by\nmost Romanian builders, including Iorga. Every process has a code, and when it's entered, the average\nmarket price is shown. We compared these averages with Iorga's\nquotes for Chiajna Monastery and found that his firm massively\ninflated the costs. While we can't comment on materials\nwithout knowing their quality, there's no doubt that Iorga charged way\nabove the market prices for labour. For example, for cutting through welded\nsteel plumbing pipes with a hand saw, his firm quoted a labour price\nof RON 32 per unit, whereas the software gives a price of\njust RON 3.60 – nearly 10 times less. As for decorative plastering,\nhis firm plastered 320 square metres at a labour\ncost of over RON 9,000, or RON 28 per square metre. It used an old code that's\nbecoming obsolete, but experts told us that three years ago,\nwhen the work was done, the cost of this work could not have\nexceeded RON 15 per square metre. And here’s a simple final example:\npainting with washable paint. Iorga quoted a labour price of RON 5,700 for\n225 square metres at Chiajna Monastery. That’s nearly four times the market price. To get a better idea, imagine a workman\nbills you over RON 5,000 for going over the walls and ceiling\nof your three-room flat with a roller. If that seems outrageous, you've\nalready paid prices like these because Iorga's invoices were\npaid with public money. - Are these churches?\n- Yes, each one's a contract. Iorga, a preferred supplier of the Church,\nhas won dozens of contracts for council-funded church renovations\nin Bucharest in recent years. These haven’t gone ahead. The finished jobs aren't here...\nThese haven't gone ahead. But Iorga isn't the Church's\nonly preferred supplier. Other favoured firms have also\nlanded renovation contracts. To find out how much public money is spent\non church construction and renovation, we asked Bucharest City Council, district\ncouncils and the State Secretariat for Faiths for details of grants to Bucharest churches\nsince Patriarch Daniel took office in 2008. The whole amount – RON 1.3 billion –\nwas taken in taxes from the public and given to the Church. Not one penny of this mountain\nof money was spent without the blessing of the Patriarch,\nwho approved every job. After three months of talking\nto Church figures and finding out how these\nhuge sums are shared out, we suddenly broke off contact. We lay low for a few weeks and then made contact again\nunder our real identity. First, we met Mr Iorga, who'd just\nsplashed out on a new motor. - Good morning, Mr Iorga.\n- Good morning. My name’s Ilie, we’ve met before. We’re making a documentary about\nhow the Church spends public money. That’s why we met before. We want to ask about the inflated\nprices in your firms’ quotes for district councils and the city council. Is this an interview? We're trying to find out where\nthe surplus cash goes… Please email any questions to me. The prices aren’t inflated at all.\nThey’re real prices, market prices. But they depend on the brief. There's one price for plaster like this,\nand other prices for other kinds of plaster. We asked other firms for quotes. Your prices are up to 10 times higher.\nFor Chiajna Monastery, for example. Email your questions to me\nand I’ll answer them, no problem. But what are you, a journalist? In what capacity do you submit\ndocumentation for the Church? We have a recording of you… We don’t do that on the Church's behalf.\nWe submit tenders… No, you submit it to authorities.\nAt District 2 Council Hall. Instead of priests. Never. - You say that in a recording…\n- I never go to District 2 Hall or the council. - You might get more money from District 2.\n- Yes? I submit at district council halls,\nthe Monuments Authority... So you do the legwork, not the priests. What could a priest do? I go and submit them everywhere.\nWherever I get money, I work. - Do you have a special relationship with the Church?\n- No. For me, in general, it's business. It's a client. If I can work\nfor it, fine. If not, okay. If I have a contract with it, I don’t\ncare where its money comes from. How do you get so many\ncontracts from churches? Through Lumina, of course. All Church tender processes\nare announced in it. You can’t find them anywhere else. If I go to a newsstand and buy Lumina… It's not on general sale! It only comes out\nin churches. Don’t you get it? The next person we tried to\nconfront was Lazăr Neacșu, who'd told us in detail how Church\ntender processes are rigged. As council meetings were being\nheld online, we went to his home. He didn’t answer.\nThe network was on its guard. He later drove off in a luxury car\nand wouldn't stop. We got hold of him on the phone. Hello, Mr Neacșu. I'm Victor Ilie,\na reporter with Recorder. How are you, Mr Gabriel Petrescu\nwith the EU funds? - Didn’t you meet me as an EU funds expert?\n- Yes. - Mr Petrescu, I got your message.\n- Yes, but my real name's Victor Ilie. - Mr Petrescu…\n- Yes, go ahead. - I’m at City Hall, come here if you want.\n- Okay. - Come here, yes.\n- We'll be right there. - Are you at City Hall?\n- Never you mind where I am. We’re at City Hall. I’m in EU Funds with Mr Gabriel Petrescu. - Any questions, talk to Mr…\n- This is a kind of research. It's the only way we could research\nmatters of public interest. I don’t care about those. I’m an honest man who saw you… We met officially at City Hall, you said\nyou handled EU funds. Was that all? When I was Mr Petrescu, you told me how\ntendering's rigged through Lumina. Nothing's rigged, that has nothing to\ndo with me, I’m not interested. I'll rephrase this. Aren’t you\nin a conflict of interest… He's gone. Our final showdown was with Aurel Mihai.\nWe met him after a service. - Hello, Father.\n- God bless you! I'm Victor Ilie, a reporter from Recorder.\nI talked to you before as Gabriel Petrescu. Why? We’re making a video documentary about\nhow the Church spends public funds and we're investigating your role in this. But this is a church. I know, we met in church on\nthe previous occasions too… Especially because you've been unfair\nto me and a lot of people. You used the name Petrescu.\nI'm sorry. Yes, it was the only way we could find out how the Orthodox Church\nspends public funds. And we’ve got recordings\nof you saying we could rig tender processes for public funds. I can’t say something like that. - Shall we listen to what you said?\n- Yes, if you like. Let me explain.\nFirstly, it’s not part of my job. You bring us a package, okay? When we get His Beatitude’s approval, that’s worth more than any guarantee\nin Strasbourg, so don't worry. Okay. So I didn’t do... I wasn't involved. And I’m sorry, I was expecting\nyou to show more… I don't know... ...moral integrity. May I go? Are you friends with Marian Iorga? - Pardon?\n- Are you friends? No. We’re acquainted,\nbut we’re not friends. I've talked to a builder friend of mine and he'd like to meet you. Gladly. He has some goals that he… Yes?\nSo that things go well. Yes. To be honest, we call everyone friends. In the biblical sense of the word. The fact that he attends\nsome church events, when there are processions\nand whatnot, I think this shows… I’m just saying, a… Lazăr Neacșu says Mr Iorga's\nquite simply your crony. Oh, yes, sure. Yes? Yes? A few months earlier, the bishop\nhad been far less humble. At our final undercover meeting, we had\nworked out how to access money and he'd assured us that if we got\nthrough all the Church’s filters, we'd join a blessed system\nthat always comes out on top. JUNE 2021 What's the feedback? I spoke to His Beatitude.\nHe has no objections. The problem is... the advisor in charge of\nmonuments and church buildings. - Was he at the meeting too?\n- Yes, the older one. He's not clear on the situation…\nwho we make the funding request to, who manages the money,\nwho authorises payments… - So I should explain the legal workings to him.\n- Exactly. I see. So that’s what he needs now\nfor things to go without a hitch. Okay. Iorga also said we’ll need some\nkind of accreditation, a kind of… To sign a contract with any church,\nwe need approval, accreditation… - It’s not clear to me, if you can explain…\n- I think you need the blessing. So that's what it is.\nOkay, now it's clearer to me... To be honest, it’s not easy\nto get into our system, but then you’ll have a very protective hat,\nyou won’t get rained on… It's quite reliable. And everything\ngoes to the boss. Yes? All of the questions and official requests\nwe sent to the Romanian Orthodox Church before and after this investigation ended hit a wall of silence.

Yes… Good job! At the biggest hospital in the country, the Emergency University Hospital Bucharest, there are no free beds even though ambulances keep bringing Covid-19 patients in critical condition. Can you bring me some water? Hmm? Can you bring me some water? You want some water? Yes.  I’ll bring you ‘pa, let’s take the photo and I’ll give you some.  Yes, the man is suspected… Of Covid, right? Yes. Fane, we need to bring the intubated one for the CT! Now? Yes, that’s what the doctor said. 19 months of the pandemic Come on ma’am, come on, push hard and I’ll help you. That’s it.  Now we turn. We turn, we turn. And down. When the machine pushes air, you pull, yes? At the same time with the machine, yes? We breathe.  What’s her saturation? 65% she had on 15 litres in the tent. I want the pulse oximeter. From the blue wire, the blue wire. Get his blood pressure. His? Yes, in a second. Can you hear me? She needs to be intubated, Costi! Can you hear me? We need the intubation kit, we have to intubate her. Don’t give me the stripper now, later. Thank you. Can you hear me? I want a butterfly, please nurses. She has a butterfly. I want you to give me, give me… Three. Not three, give me five, please. 50 milligrams. Can you hear me? Does she have any other health issues? Who took her in? No one took her in. Did the ambulance bring her? She’s Covid positive… ma’am we just saw her saturation going down. Cosmin, how do we know, she’s positive? We don't. But what was her blood pressure? Blood pressure? Let’s get her ready to… Laurențiu, give me a plaster. The medicine. In a second, we have an emergency. What? We have an emergency. Tens of Covid-19 patients end up daily at the emergency unit, where they are stuck for days while waiting for a free bed in the intensive care. We have no free space in the ICU, only one for him. Apart from that, all patients here need the ICU,         \n  but they can’t, we have no space. Yes, I’ll be there in a second. I’ll be there in a second, yes, of course. I have to go there, I’ll talk to the transfer coordinator  \n to transfer some patients. Because look how the patients are staying, look, with the extension, for him. This is not an appropriate space to have an extension,  but they need at least 7-8 days in the ICU. But, how many are here? Look and count. Is there another free ventilator here? No. We have no free sockets for the oxygen. Bring him here. You bring him here. OK. There’s no free stretchers, there is absolutely\n no possibility to fit anyone else in here. And we’re adapting, they will also sit… As long as they can handle to sit in a chair \nand their saturation is decent,  they will sit, \nand the critical patients will lay down in bed. We'll improvise and put him on that CPAP, \nthe one over there... I have never lived through such a situation. \nIt’s my fifth year of residency. Honestly, never... \nI mean I had a lot of patients at once… But the many patients come, get healthy \nand then go home or they’re admitted. In this case, they are coming and staying here. It’s worse than at the ICU. The girls from the infirmary were telling me \nthis morning they have 60 patients for one table.  Yes? 60 patients for one table.  Worse than at the ICU. This is not possible! They’re so many! Please try and keep calm. \nThe more agitated you are, the worse you will feel. At some point you break down. You simply break down because you can’t anymore. And all of them are not vaccinated. All of them. Are you vaccinated or you didn’t have…? It doesn’t matter anymore. Did you manage to get the vaccine? No. No? No. As long as the producer is ambiguous \nand inconsistent in what he’s saying… the doctors as well… they aren't the smartest. And then, let’s take it rationally, right? When I saw that even the double vaccinated ones are... And you didn’t trust it, basically… Well, how can you trust it \nwhen even your ilk don’t trust each other? And do you wish you were vaccinated now? No. No? No. Well… logically speaking, right? I’ve been here for two days. Was it the biggest mistake of my life? What? That I didn’t get the vaccine. And now I suffer the consequences.  But why did you not get the vaccine, were you… Why? Why? Well, that’s the big question. Influence. What, we should get the vaccine? \nUs, the older ones? We’re immune. It’s hard. Very hard. There’s less educated people who didn’t know better. We thought that… We went through the first wave, the second,\n I’ll be ok in the fourth one as well, no trouble. Stay like this and breath in through the mouth \nand out through the nose, don’t talk. In through the mouth and out through the nose, yes? Don’t fight the machine, yes? We don’t have a chance, if you don’t help us. So, the science does one part, yes? You… decide how it goes from here. Say the Lord's Prayer and it will be ok. The wave is also caused by lack of awareness and misinformation. The politicians should have been clearer. Yes? And if they care about the wellbeing of the citizens, \nthey should advise them to get vaccinated Because it’s the only way out.  I’ve been working for 33 years. Have you ever seen something like this in 33 years? Only during the Revolution. Auch! Be a bit patient, there are a lot of transfers. At the same time, we get new patients, we’re having a hundred talks \nwith the transfer department, please be patient.  Grandma, we need to give you a mask, which you will have to keep on. So we don’t end up worse… Go... Is any air coming in? Open wide… Now close it. Inhale like you’re smoking. If the oxygenation in your lungs doesn’t increase, we’ll have to put a mask on, that will push the air with pressure. That’s not the intubation?! No, it’s not “the intubation”. We don’t want to get there. That’s bad... Yes. Yes? It’s like… hell, like during a war, you know? I feel as if I’m getting ready to… to work during wartime, honestly... I noticed you aren't wearing the \npersonal protective equipment. Why is that? First of all, it's very hard to move  in the PPE. There's one thing to just stand still... but working and moving aroundd is hard.  We are vaccinated, we have gone through the disease we protect ourselves... This will be our reality from now on. Look, it’s dripping! What? It’s dripping? Where? Look, look! It’s dripping on me. What's dripping? It’s dripping! Some kind of flooding! Take a look, it’s dripping! Look there! Yes, let’s move the patient somewhere else. Let’s move… We are going to call somebody, be patient.\nLet’s move the patient somewhere else, right? Check. Is it still dripping on him? Well, where should I move him? \nIt’s dripping, look, it’s here! No, it’s coming from above. \nIt’s not dripping from the oxygen tank. Good thing this is not plugged in. And what should we put there? \nShould we use that bucket? It is important to keep the mask on, \notherwise you will die! Otherwise, we are going to put a “pipe” in... No, it’s not all right. What are you going to put in? A “pipe”, down your throat! Take a deep breath in. \nDon’t hit my hand, please! Take a deep breath in! It's important to put this mask on, please! Oh no, it hurts my nose! Come on, it's not hurting your nose… Take a deep breath in! Look, now it’s not on your nose anymore,  it’s all right. You cannot breath without it, you cannot take it off! Take a deep breath in. You have to breath \nwith the help of this machine, okay? It’s a big mask, like this… with a higher oxygen pressure. It will help you breathe, okay? Look, like the lady over there. Okay? You have to breath, \nyou have to listen to us, okay? For you to be fine, you need to listen to us. Okay? Let's try and breathe with the machine, yes? Yes... With this mask? What should we do? You need to stay calm, okay? Come on, be calm, yes? You're tired, I get it. Would you like some water? Okay, the oxygen is coming through! Don’t take it off! It’s okay, it’s okay… Take it easy. Until we're better, \nwe need to take it easy, okay? I want to sleep! It’s all right, just a second… Okay? Drink a bit of water and then… Keep your mask on for a little bit, will you? It’s okay, drink some water. Done? Well done. And now stay put, okay? In half an hour, I will put it on again, okay? Until then, stay put, okay? Wait, wait! Grandpa, pay attention! \nLook at me for a second! We can’t go on like this! It’s impossible! I will use oxygen, if I give you a mask… Use it for someone else, someone who can take it… Please stay put, \nwe have patients in worse condition, please! Come one, take a deep breath, please! \nBreathe! Water! Water! Water, water... Just a second, hold on, just a second! Just wait! Got it? That’s all? Would you like more water? Let him be, please, let him be! Assist control. Oh, no, you need to use this… Do you need any help, Georgiana? Over 10 million Romanians are not vaccinated Are you aware of the risks, if you get vaccinated? Look, cowards! Look, cowards! Well, I,  for example, do not trust this vaccine. Why don’t I trust it? Why? This is a question… Well, nobody knows where the virus comes from! You hit the soft spot!\nBig Pharma, welcome to our world! I think that my treatment scheme is... wonderful… So you think that, \ngenerally speaking, the scheme is the key! The key, for me, is in the scheme. Clarithromycin… Absolutely, yes. If you have this kind of treatment,  there is no need for the vaccine anymore!… Our protest today… is… for our freedom! Our protest today… is… for the people... for our Romanian people... for our chance to live… Freedom, freedom, freedom..."}

We have been facing this situation for over 30 years and I think we are all guilty in this country, because we have been tolerating, for 30 years, to live in such a medical situation. I know Romania's healthcare system very well.  I wish you good health! We are planning to modernize the healthcare system, to increase the quality of medical services. Hello everyone! This is the layout of the Metropolitan Hospital which is being built in Bucharest.  I think you are waiting to hear a lot of things about a strategic field:  the healthcare field. Without a solid healthcare policy, strategically built, a nation cannot trust it's physical and moral destiny. The Romanian healthcare system is organized as it was during Stalin's era. I do not think there is a magical solution for a healthcare system... The Romanian healthcare is a feudal system.  It is one of the systems that's under the least amount of democratic pressure in Romania. From pain most of the money are made. You must make a lot of compromises here to advance in the career. That’s it. What should I do? Should I sit and watch the patient?  Wait for him to hand me an envelope with 200 RON, or what? No way! I leave the country! Does this healthcare have any purpose? Does what I currently do have any meaning? It doesn’t have any meaning. Two neurosurgeons from the Colentina hospital who had returned to the country from France to make a difference, have abandoned the fight. In that moment when you say goodbye to your friends, to your family, it's terrible! You suffocate. There is a lot of poverty in the hospital. We are currently at a turning point. In the healthcare system things cannot go on in this way! The healthcare law was modified, in the ten years since its entry into force, at least 2000 times. Whatever a party does is no longer good, and we are starting all over again, don’t we? Well, yes, but let’s kill the puppy. I told this to my colleagues: let’s kill the puppy. It must be done at some point... Excuse me, for a healthcare reform, a health minister is just a prop.  Imagine a water balloon that pops because of the pressure and water starts to gush. The Romanian healthcare system has been governed for 10 years not by changing the balloon, but by desperately patching up the holes.   We are dying! We are dying in our homes! The Romanian Healthcare System                        A Recorder Documentary  Good evening and welcome to the news! Last night, an ambulance crew has abandoned in the middle of the street a comatose patient. Because he had not received medical care for more than two hours, the man died with the perfusion tube still attached to his arm.  The staff operating the respective ambulance is currently under police investigation for manslaughter.  Last night, a 47 old man has been abandoned on Heliade Radulescu Street. He was found dead by police personnel from Precinct 8.  The man had with him a medical chart issued by a Bucharest hospital. Constantin Nica has died with the perfusion tube still attached to his hand on a sidewalk in the vicinity of his home. Nica was moved last night with an ambulance to the hospitals St. Pantelimon, Tunari and Victor Babes, where he was denied hospitalization. Nurse Mariana Zuica says she has received an order from the doctor on duty of the ambulance to deliver the patient home.   Unable to find the home address, the ambulance team has left Constantin Nica next to a fence. The police making inquiries into Constantin Nica’s case have established that the doctors on duty at the hospitals where the patient was transported by ambulance have endangered the life of a person unable to care for himself. This image of a man abandoned on the pavement by those who should have saved him summarizes the debacle in which the Romanian healthcare system was in the mid-90s. It was bad. Very bad.   Worse than before. There was tremendous poverty. There was a dreadful poverty. You lived with the feeling that every day could end in an abyss. That was the feeling. And we had to… it was like a collapsing house and one wouldn’t know where to go and “wait a moment. This pillar needs reinforcing. Oh, my God! The window will fall out!” This was the feeling. It was an eternal patching up. In winter, I remember, the wind was blowing in those hallways. In the pediatric department the icy wind was blowing, as we were located on a hill in Targu Mures. We shielded the windows with some rags. It was a situation with a lot of misgivings, and I will give you only one example from the orthopedics department. One of the surgical interventions in case of a neck of femur fracture is done by inserting a screw in the medullar channel to fix the neck of the femur. These screws were unavailable, and they were manufactured from welding electrodes, refashioned and sharpened at a factory in town and delivered to the orthopedics department to be used for treating patients.  I remember there was something ominous regarding the hospital I worked for. Being a hospital for pulmonary illnesses, patients with respiratory distress syndrome came for treatment and you needed oxygen and you made some computations, I don’t know, around six or seven in the evening and reached the frightful conclusion that you only had two oxygen tanks and the actual need until the next day was for three tanks. And then, on whom do you give up? You were not able to save some people, but I was never able to say to anyone “take the oxygen away from this one, let him go…” It was something against what it means to be human. During the communist age, hospitals were built, and progress was made in the Romanian healthcare,  but the austerity policy of the 80s had left the healthcare system in a dire condition. During the first years after the revolution, the healthcare has continued to degrade, together with the entire Romanian society.  The foreign press who had come to report on the 1989 change of regime had then their first shock:  the Romanian hospitals. One of the most serious problems facing Romania's new government will be the rebuilding of the health service. Under the Ceausescu regime, parts of the it became severely run down.  This is the city's oldest and best-known hospital but its proud record of medical tradition is rotting away after decades of neglect.  The nurses say they have no painkillers for the patients and no antibiotics.  It was the worst of communism and  the worst of capitalism combined.  The capitalism came with a lack of rules and with the delusion of the easily earned money  and from communism Romania had inherited the system of informal payments.  For decades, the doctors were abandoned in a destructive zone: Having low salaries but also the tacit approval of the system to open their pockets in front of their patients.  It is obviously so, because many times there was a life-or-death issue.  The wages in the medical field were incredibly low. I started my career making 1,960 or 70 lei per month, while a metal worker earned 4,000.  And even more. Much more. At that time, the roots of the informal payments system were laid, at least partially.  I think that the communist state has also encouraged such practices, because that's how physicians became easy to control and even to extort. During all the communist years, this practice became prevalent and even the norm…  Everybody knew it, from Ceausescu to the last man, they knew you had to give money to the physician. They did not raise the wages; it was an open secret where everybody won.  The physician had something to win from this. This is inherited from that time! The foulness was so normalized, you didn’t have a choice.  I remember physicians of a certain generation who would receive the envelope and blush, although they were 50 years old or more. To blush at 50 years old or more… And still, they were taking it. Because if they would have declined, they would have marred the market.  I realized on my own that the envelope changes people. Do you know when I figured that out?  When they came for check-ups  they seemed different. You know?   And I was suddenly made aware of the risk of distancing ourselves from our mission, from our job.  Our job is to take care of the ill, not to differentiate between them. But, you see, some are not open to this and you are already in this money mix, and it never ends.  It's very hard  to get out. - Did you get the money?\n- No. - What's in your mouth?\n-  Here! Here, drop it down! No! This is... Please, leave it there You sit here, OK? Do you often eat money? The communist custom of bribing  met with the infinite possibilities offered by democracy.  The post-communist Romania has continued to pay its physicians poorly, leaving them in the hands of their patients but releasing them from the fear of the institutions of a totalitarian state.  In democracy, the bribe has become more than a survival mean, it has become a business opportunity.  Many years after ‘90... healthcare became a business.  Not where business should take place, but in areas where business should not be allowed. In 2002, I was contacted by somebody, I cannot provide a name, and I was offered, in 2002,  a position in a large university clinic with a wage of 30-40 thousand dollars.  In 2002, a studio apartment in central Bucharest was around 5-6 thousand dollars. I had to pay a bribe; I was told directly. Obviously, I didn’t have the money as I was living in a rented apartment, just stared a family and had a 1-year-old child. And now the question is: how does a young physician obtain the money he used to buy himself a position in the clinic? Obviously, by opening up your pockets to the patient. Some asked directly, others just received.  I would be a hypocrite to say I did not receive anything during this period.  I admit that with the 50-dollar wage I received per month, it would have been impossible to pay rent and to support a family. I, a Ph.D. student, attending classes, with a scholarship, earn three million four hundred fifty lei (i.e. 70 EUR).  It is a shame that that the Romanian state invests so much in the education of young physicians but offers nothing further.   A specialist physician earns around ten million (i.e. 203 EUR). From 1990 and until the beginning of the 2000s the Romanian healthcare system was dominated by this contrast. On one side, you had the filth in the hospitals and the inadequate wages paid to young doctors, and on the other, the rise of rich and power-hungry physicians. The ill-intended say that one of the so -called rewards for the pressure and gravity of your job is a certain taste for luxury, for the latest car model, for the latest cell phone … What do you like? Everything that's beautiful, everything that's safe, everything that's technical, everything that's well done. The taste for luxury, fed by large amounts of money, lead to monopoly on patients.  This explains why many high skilled professors wanted to operate every case, leaving the residents aside. There is a link between the economical side and “I shall perform all surgeries” “I shall treat them all” and “I shall see all patients”. The moment you become addicted to the money in the envelope, you will want to perform surgeries until you’re 100 years old. Maybe there is a concern that if I teach you, you will replace me.  So, the resident physician, theoretically, should have been instructed by the professor, as this was his job, to teach. But what did that mean? “If I teach, he'll get my bribe.\" It is very difficult to get to the operating table because the one in charge did not allow it. Just like that. For many reasons, the boss was not allowing you to perform surgery. We, my colleagues and I, who passed the residency exam in a honest way, went through a period of at least five years of not even once leading a surgery. From a professional standpoint, this is devastating because you complete the residency, the specialization, not knowing anything.  Without having performed one surgery. You see a patient and don't know what to do.  I was in this position. And so was everyone else. I was a resident in a large hospital in Bucharest and we went to colleagues from our specialty and we were told “you should be happy that in the fifth year of residency you get to watch the great professor performing surgery”. In the fifth year, when one should be at the top of the professional competence, to be able to operate anything. Anything. You would often meet people who completed their residency without a single opportunity to lead a surgery. In the operating room, the professors' every move is followed by several students trying to steal the trade.  A month after starting my residency, I told my professors and colleagues that I will take all necessary measures to make sure I operate a cerebral aneurism before the seventh year of residency. Everybody, absolutely everybody, I remember it was somehow… I didn’t understand why they were laughing. They were laughing, teary-eyed, saying “Oh, my God, what are you talking about? Get a grip! Aneurism? No way.” I operated my first aneurism when I was in my fifth year. But not in Romania... No. No. I left the country during the second or third year of residency.  With low wages and limited professional perspectives, many young physicians left Romania while still residents. Poorly paid and with double shifts, one by one, the physicians have started to give up and to leave to foreign countries.  The French are even looking for ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons, or graduated psychiatrists with five years of experience in a medical office. Everybody must speak French.  Comment ça va? Ça va bien? The physicians’ migration started after the 90s, when one in two hundred people left the country. The second wave came after 1996. The boom occurred in January 2002, when the Schengen visa was lifted.  The low wages were not the reason young physicians left the country.  Most left because of the two following reasons: the head of the department or the lack of materials. In the end, people saw that they were losing lives they could have been saved if basic instruments were available. 80% of those who left are providing medical care to the ill people in EU countries: France, Belgium, Netherlands, England, and Germany. Good bye! Rather than working in Bucharest, I would prefer moving to a small town in Germany. Of course it is not Bucharest, but I do not want to be trampled on. I really cannot say how many physicians left. Between 15 and 20 thousand, I believe. They left because, firstly, that's life, and secondly, because the professional evolution is not they way it should be. It's not. You must make a lot of compromises to advance your career. That’s it. A lot. Some had to carry tiles for the country houses the heads of department were building, to give them pigs for Easter and Christmas, all kinds of material compensation... A lot of things…  Having control over the lives of the patients who waited to be saved and the destinies of the residents wanting to advance professionally, many of the great professors have put themselves on pedestals way above the mere mortals. Healthcare, in comparison to other professions, is a… Please excuse me, but it's a profession where you're on an ego trip.  I still remember the time when I was a student in one of the well-known surgery departments of that town, and around six thirty, seven in the morning, I don’t know precisely,  but very early, much earlier than stated in our schedule, we had to wait for the professor, the head of the surgical department, all in a line as if we were in the army, from the youngest student to the associate professor. With our backs to the wall with our hands on the wall. When Lucan entered, you would hear “Boss, boss, boss, boss!” There was a rumor of fear which started from the legless patient - that was my shock back in 2002 – as I was first a patient at the institute, how can you sit upright in your bed when you have no legs? I saw that unnatural posture during the care rounds.  \"The boss is coming!\" A large part of the blame lies with the press. He put his life in the service of a country which has not encouraged his performances and he managed to make of Romania a world example in pediatric orthopedics. After two decades dedicated to the orthopedics department of the Marie Curie hospital in Bucharest, the physician, professor and, most of all, the human Gheorghe Burnei asks now for Romania to respect its physicians and patients. The press was lied to for 20 years by this physician with global innovations, with … \"The physician who operates children with the help of God\" Five thousand lei in Romania, 75 thousand pounds in England. In a few years he could probably buy his own subway there, and ride it continuously. In 30 days, he could move altogether in England, paperwork included and to work for one of the top ten orthopedics clinics in London. But he believes in something, which is to be found here.  All these bribe taking professors had behind them religious depictions, they were believers.  Since when do you have the sacred image on that wall? Since 1990. It is the godly image which watches us during all surgical interventions we perform.  And during the years, of course we had an exceptionally large number of patients who passed through his hands with frightening outcomes. We are talking about a physician who performed experimental treatments on his underage patients Without notifying the parents about the risks these interventions entailed for their children and at the same time without ever taking responsibility for any error. You've got here late. Amputation is an option. This is... Whatever God wants. We must live. He is 58 years old and since he was a kid, he felt an attraction for the intricate and complex joints.  I always loved to work beyond the limit of the possible.  In Romania no one measures the real, objective performance of a physician or of a clinic. There are many living statues which were created but which are – in reality – no statues, meaning that they do not have neither the professional prestige,  nor the professional competence they seem to have in the eyes of the public. Professor Burnei has grown up from being an economics high schooler in Targoviste to one of the best orthopedic pediatricians in the world and it wasn’t easy at all. He understood very well that he would not be questioned in any way. If he told the press that the next day he would have a medical premiere, the press would come, they would believe him, and they would broadcast the story. There have been situations in which the parents would try to contact the journalists later and tell them that the medical premiere was a fiasco but they were altogether dismissed. In 2016, the journalist Luiza Vasiliu has revealed on the independent platform Casa Jurnalistului many serious malpractice cases of the surgeon Gheorghe Burnei, and she challenged the great professor. During your entire carrier you had no malpractice cases? No. No. I had a few cases in which, completely falsely, it was told I was culpable but I was not culpable. One of the things that astonished me the most is the fact that the medical world was aware of it. The medical world within the his specialization, many parents who went with their children to other doctors received reactions such as “Why did you take him to Burnei? Do you really believe everything you see on TV?” But no one from the medical establishment ever dared to question his status or skill. The main deterrent in revealing these inadequate medical acts of this physician was article 37 of the Deontological Code of the Physicians’ College in accordance with which, if you were aware of any inadequate medical acts by one of your colleagues, the first step was to bring this to the attention of the colleague, after that you had to inform the head of department, after that the Bucharest Physicians’ College, and after that the central physicians’ college and let's see: you went and informed Burnei. Good. You went to the head of department. Who was that? Burnei. You went to the Physicians’ College. Who was the head of that entity? Burnei. You went to the highest commission of the Physicians’ College. Who lead that? Burnei. You went higher to the Advisory Commission of the Ministry of Health. Who lead that? Burnei. You went to the top highest panel, which is the Forensic Expertise Commission of the Forensic Institute. Who lead it? Burnei. How could anyone get through all these filters? You would have been stopped at the first level. You are the head of the malpractice commission for orthopedics.  I want to ask you. During these years – the cases which were brought in front of you.  Were they serious cases? You judged them considering what? Were the physicians sanctioned when their culpability was ascertained? No, I didn’t … where did you say I was? Aren’t you the head of the malpractice commission for orthopedics within the Physicians’ College? No. No. But this is what the website shows. No. Aaaa – at the Physicians’ College, yes. Yes. At the Physicians’ College, yes. Yes. That's where the patients’ complaints are firstly reviewed, before reaching the court of law.  I had a few cases, yes, of course, I had a few cases.  Just a few, not many.  No, a few cases which were concerning me. They were addressed to me, I analyzed them and... Usually...   At the moment... The malpractice cases are most of the time those cases that are fully in breach of therapeutical instructions, but they weren’t...I didn’t have any such cases. From here on I could see he was losing his composure. In front of us was a man who was slowly losing his composure, because these were questions which he never had to answer in front of a camera and because he didn’t expect to be asked about malpractice, judicial trials, and pain. Surrounded by the troops of the Anti-Corruption General Direction, the surgeon Gheorghe Burnei reached Marie Curie Hospital from the capital city around 16:00 o'clock. All morning, the investigators have searched his house. A parent has registered a criminal complaint against the professor Gheorghe Burnei, for asking for money to perform surgery on his child. After four years of trial, the physician Gheorghe Burnei was sentenced to 2 and a half years of probation for taking bribes. I understand that the accusation was for accepting, not for soliciting a bribe.  It is not an excuse, but we should not target medical personalities. Another criminal investigation in rem was opened for attempted murder and murder after other parents accused the orthopedic physician of mistreating their children or causing their deaths through unauthorized experiments. Tell us, doctor… Please talk with my attorney, no, no. These professors have built their power, how? They performed surgeries on influent journalists, media owners, members of the parliament, mayors, presidents of county councils. In exchange for the medical services most of the time preferentially received, the influential people offered these physicians media exposure, important titles, and privileges. In one word: power. One of the most powerful physicians in Romania was Mihai Lucan, who in 2017 was detained by the prosecutors under the charge of embezzling the Cluj Institute for Urology and Renal Transplant. After ten hours of hearings, the physician Mihai Lucan exited the DIICOT headquarters in shackles. Just a few minutes earlier he amazed the investigators, as an envelope containing 5000 EURO fell out of his pocket. I do not know if greed is purely Romanian. I believe we do not have the tools to block the manifestations of callousness and until we do not change this, such things will continue to occur. We will be the same. Do you believe that similar things do not happen in France?  They do. But, there, the professor shall be held responsible by someone who is not necessarily his direct coordinator within the university, but some outsiders who will start asking about the money. In Romania, for decades, no one asked the physicians anything about the money. The investigation on Mihai Luncan came after many years in which the state’s institutions had kept their eyes closed and the doctors were used with this lack of accountability. Mihai Lucan, Gheorghe Burnei and all other professors with controversial reputations we have presented in this documentary, refused to appear in front of the camera to share their point of view regarding the serious accusations they are facing. Tens of complaints regarding illegal charges and the bias against certain patients the urologist Mihai Lucan showed… … the embezzlement of the Cluj urology and renal transplant institute, has acquired debt exceeding 400,000 euro. The physician Mihai Luncan has attempted to destroy evidence, to influence witnesses and he even transferred 600,000 USD to the account of a close friend. Despite these serious accusations, the inquiry targeting Mihai Luncan hit a wall and the prosecutors were not able to reach a conclusion until this moment. There was a constant suspicion that Lucan was powerful enough to prevent the inquiry from reaching a conclusion. It is very difficult for a politician not to support a professor who once perform surgery on him. The medical professor is equal with the politician or above him and then things get stuck because the system has been built on these godlike people who got to decide who lived and who died. Physicians are well represented on the corridors of power.  I’d say very well represented in comparison to other professions. I don’t think doctors are more present, I believe they are more visible. There is a difference. Doctor Serban Bradisteanu was convicted to one year of probation for favoring Adrian Nastase. In June 2012 the ex-prime-minister was convicted to two years in the case called “Trofeul calitatii” and Bradisteanu, the head of the cardiovascular surgery department at Floreasca hospital, has prevented the police for six days from taking Nastase to prison. In many cases, doctors entering politics gave the impression that they didn't do this to improve the system, but only to sit at the same table with those who have the power. Even in Bucharest, there is a powerful and influential doctor who chose two smart, professionally skilled and convincing residents  and told them: “You go become a member of the social democratic party. You a member of the liberal party”. And he explained why. Because it is important to always have power.  It is important to always have access to the minister’s door or to the one of the Health Insurance Agency.  This power meant that politics allowed the professors to keep their privileges and take control over the big hospitals. The rest of the medical units have been moved under the control of the local authorities in 2010 when the decentralization started. Briefly put, they were left under the administration of the local political interests. Mayors and the presidents of county councils were granted the authority to select the hospital managers  and so the power to control resources. When you appoint a manager, you obtain a very important control over the way public acquisitions are organized in the hospital. We are talking about money. Lots of money. You gain a very important control over the positions in that hospital. We are talking about relations. The board of directors, the directing committee, the manager, the medical directors, financial directors, accountants, heads of office, nurses who, let's say... come from the intimate atmosphereof the feudal domain. You, as local politician, who appoints the manager of a hospital, suddenly get two additional stars on your epaulets. Because you control the resources. Today we talk about Braila, where hospitals have become an investment paradise through the business of the president of the county council. After he took over several medical units through the decentralization, he contracted modernization works for billions of lei, which were transferred from the local budget to his pockets. The problems started with the decentralization, when the hospital was put under the control of the county council. The employees were accusing the head of the county council for entering into damaging contracts  as soon as he took over the hospitals. The paving of the alleys, already damaged, costed more than a billion lei in old currency.  I told them during the procurement procedure, one billion two hundred, I told him **** do it. You used to work for 200,000, now use two billions, because you are not doing it for me, you’re doing it for these unfortunates who have to thread through the mud. The doctors are wondering why the wheelchair ramps weren’t redone, since it's impossible for patients to use it. - Wait, you will drop me.\n- We won't. - Oh, dear... While receiving the authority to control hiring and hospitals procurement, the local authorities had no responsibility regarding the financing of the healthcare units under their control. It is clearly stated in the law that the local authorities have the responsibility to provide co-financing and so on but, as it usually happens in the wonderful Romanian law, it is stated you have responsibilities, but there are no criteria on how to measure it. It's just like a general idea. Like a cloud. For example, during the year when I was a manager, the president of the county council told me “This year I will not pay a dime for the hospital. Figure it out.” The TB department of Arad County Hospital operates in a building built a hundred years ago, initially designed as a school. Still old, but less is shambles, is the building housing the obstetrics and gynecology department. Currently, less that 1% of the healthcare system budget comes from the local budgets.  What does me administrating this hospital mean, if I am paying zero lei for it? There is a lot of poverty in the hospital. Humiliated patients, hosted in squalid rooms. Frustrated and indifferent nurses and physicians. This is the image you find in most of the hospitals of Romania. We're the ones buying catheters.  They don’t have what they need.  Meaning? They have no cleaning materials for the floors, they have no gloves, there are no conditions. These would have to be changed, if possible, these are… as they are. Some municipalities have 25-26% of their budget dedicated to organizing cultural events, right? We know about these – that they are a public heist -- the cities' days, all kind of cultural events where the money is basically given to the parties' favourites. While the local hospital of the respective city might receive 0.1, 0.2, 0.5% of the city halls' budget.  I have seen maybe two bugs on the floors since I arrived, a week ago. Not more. Only two. At the bathroom, there is this open window making it so cold, you can’t go wash or shower.  Bathrooms… I wanted to take a shower. I am from the rural area. I was frightened. Have you been there, have you taken a shower? No shower – we don’t have one of those. The sink, as it can be seen, cannot be turn of, it's constantly dripping. The fridge is not working. Since I moved to this department, it's been like this. The beds are improper, full of rust. If the hospital has bad beds or not enough money for the physician to ensure the best treatment, the main action people should be taking would be to knock at the county council president’s door or at the mayor’s and ask: “Why haven’t you allocated more money for the hospital? Are you not interested in the health of our community?” This is what living in a community means. The community must learn to voice its opinions and say “No, for us it is irrelevant if you plant decorative flowers on November 20th, it is important to have a multifunctional medical center.” I don’t see the involvement of organizations, of the public administration, of the mayor, of the county councils. They all should be partners in a social dialogue to discuss how we want to proceed regarding the healthcare system.  The public authorities have a greater control over the money distribution and have minimal responsibilities because people are not informed enough about how important the local authorities are. It is not clearly stated, not only in the citizen’s mind, but in general, in the laws, in this legislative corpus, these things are not very clearly stated. I do not know who is responsible, the ministry, the directions for public health, the president of the county council, the mayor, the entire system. People don’t know who is responsible because the healthcare system is a huge and complicated machinery, and its modes of operation are very difficult to understand for the regular citizen. The only way to navigate this labyrinth and to untangle at least partially its mechanisms is to follow the money flow that's feeding it.  Operating the healthcare system costs us more than 9 billion euro per year. And, for the most part, this money comes from the contributions paid by employees to the national fund for social health insurance. These contributions are collected by the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the National Health Insurance House. The direct contributions of the citizens are not enough to ensure the full functioning of the system. This may also be because two thirds of the insured citizens are exempt from paying any contribution. So, to keep the system afloat, the state subsidizes the funds of the National Health Insurance House with significant amounts, through the Ministry of Health. To these funds you can add the amounts allocated through European funds, programs of the World Bank and financing from the local authorities. These funds are unpredictable and differ from year to year.  The funding of the medical system is therefore relying on the money received from the National Health Insurance House, approximately 9 billion euro collected from citizens  and from the subventions of the Ministry.  This money is distributed among all providers of healthcare services, from hospitals to family doctors, who are paid funds from the House for the type of services they perform. The most frequent indicator being the complexity of the treated case. From the moment they enter through the hospital door, the patient becomes a string of calculations registered in an informatic system. He is checked up, receives a diagnostic, is operated, receives post op care. Every service received on this route has an associated diagnostic code assigned to determine complexity. For example, the costs for an appendicitis operation theoretically includes the costs of all materials needed during the operation, the surgical team’s work, but also the work of the nurses changing the dressing during the following days. If the appendicitis operated patient has other preexistent conditions, such as heart failure or anemia,  on his chart shall appear a corresponding code because it has implied an additional treatment. So supplementary costs. Before discharging from the hospital, all diagnostic codes on the patient’s chart shall be inserted in an informatic system Together with other information which will be consider in the final calculation, such as sex and age. The system ponders all these parameters, and it generates a diagnostics group called DRG group. This group has a relative value associated, representing the complexity of the case. In fact, by calculating an average of the DRG groups for the patients who used its services the hospital measures the complexity of the cases treated during the respective month. It is like a collective photograph of the patients treated during that time frame. This average showing complexity is called ICM – Index of Case Mix.  This is multiplied with the number of patients treated in the respective hospital, and with another coefficient, called TCP – tariff per pondered case -- which has financial value, and helps transforming the complexity index in a money amount. From multiplying these parameters, a final amount shall result, which the hospital shall settle with the National Health Insurance House. This settling system, based on DRG groups, through which billions of euros in the health system’s budget are split, is not working so well as it would theoretically appear. Romania took it from the Australian health system But transformed it in a local patchwork.  The Australian system is the most complex, it is a point of reference in the world.  The DRG system. Everybody will say, if you ask the physicians in the hospital, they will tell you that we have adopted the Australian system. It is true, we have adopted it, but in 2011 we have put it aside and invented a Romanian one. We, in 2011, lacking the money to pay for the DRG Australian license, put up a Romanian one, very simple. Practically, the system kept fewer DRG codes and simplified things so drastically that the medical services could no longer be discerned by complexity. The financial allocation between a normal birth and one with complications has shrunk so much, it was needed a compromise solution. The difference based on a tariff per balanced case which became variable from one healthcare provider to another. In this way it became possible for a big hospital, as the Fundeni Institute, to multiply the complexity level with a tariff of 1800 lei. While a smaller unit like the Campeni town hospital has a TCP of 1475 lei. Instead of being differentiated exclusively on the complexity of treated cases, the hospitals got differentiated based on a variable tariff, arbitrarily established.  They adjusted from tariff. And they started to adjust from tariff. And in a few years, the difference between tariffs became very significant, so that there is double difference between a type five hospital and a type one, such as Fundeni, which has 2,800. If you do the same thing in five different hospitals, you will get five different values as money is concerned. The citizen should ask, in the first place, the suppression of the different balanced tariffs.  Because we can start from a fundamental idea: every child is born equal in Romania. I am asking you: is it correct for a child born at Lehliu Gara, let’s say, or at Campeni, to receive for the same medical act with 30, 40, or even 50% less money than one born at Floreasca, the university municipal hospital as it is known here in Bucharest? The lower amount settled by a town hospital means worse medical conditions for the newborn delivered in this unit.  The newborns are weighted with a 20-year-old device, and the mother are made to sit behind a moldy wall. Automatically you cannot have the same disinfection, you cannot have the same materials, you cannot renew your devices so often, because you cannot save money at 680 lei compared with 1400. Without discussing the fact that a small hospital has no residents. While a university hospital will always have physicians. So, practically a child will be attended by more people, compared with a town hospital where often there are only a physician and a nurse. These huge gaps between small hospitals in the province and the hospitals in the university centers have occurred also because the professors in the healthcare system have had high positions and they had the authority to decide. Taking advantage of their status, they favored the major hospitals when funding from the state budget was provided.  Eventually we fall on the saying about the lion’s share. Automatically if the system was led, and usually when physicians were ministers of health they were from the university field, they pulled towards the university environment. It would be right for a small hospital to receive more money for the same medical act than a large hospital. Because then, in ten years, we would have good hospitals also at Lehliu Gara, and Sighisoara, and at Campeni, and anywhere. For the money distribution in the medical system to be as equitable as possible and to stop favoring some hospitals in the detriment of others, more money for healthcare would be required. No government was open to this effort, continuing to support the same patching in which the Health Insurance Houses settle amounts based on an arbitrarily established tariff and using DRG groups that were not updated for many years. If in Germany you access the German DRG, you will see they update it monthly, to reflect the market prices. We have never in a real manner in Romania calculated the costs of the healthcare system. Which means we do not know how much it costs an appendicitis or a birth, as we were talking about births. We settle 680 lei, or 1400 lei or 1500 lei but how much does it really cost we do not know. Many times, have I said that this is the largest official lie that the Romanian governments of the last 10 years ever told, notwithstanding the party. This official lie has the following content in Romania: We, the government, provide you with all medical services you need for the money you pay. The truth, and the follow up, is that we, Romanians, do not pay the state enough money for healthcare as to cover all our claims and the services we need. Why not saying it as it is? Obviously, because it is extremely politically inconvenient. For this lie, which is entirely motivated by populist politics, for this lie to work and have legs to run, because it is at least ten years old, one must use his pen to draw a trick. The drawn trick is the following: Do you come in a public Romanian hospital? Do you want to get an MRI? On the real market, an MRI costs 400 euros, real costs. In Romania, the state pays 150 euro. The difference, although absent on paper, is real.  And this difference is seen in all things we must endure. It may be that the hospitals are dirty, or there are not sufficient MRIs to have within the insurance you pay.  Either, either, either… We leave many people without access to healthcare, this is it. The disease gets worse, and they die. We have avoidable deaths. The highest avoidable mortality rate in the European Union. We must come with... Obviously, everyone is aware that we need fresh money in the healthcare system.  In real terms we have a three times lower financing that the European average, in real terms, comparing the amounts.  We allocate 1000 Euro per insured person per year, and in the European Union they allocate 3000 Euro per insured person per year. The problem was that there was never a strategy in place. Everything was done for immediate necessity or for the next step to be taken and it has always been like this.  And practically, as we in 30 years had 30 healthcare ministers obviously, the system has developed in accordance with the possibilities and vision of the person leading the ministry… In the last 31 years we had 29 health ministers, some with more than one term. Not one has been preoccupied to elaborate a coherent strategy or to take over something from his predecessors. They all modified the system in accordance with the needs of the moment and the interests of the party in power.  The healthcare law was modified in the ten years, since its entry into force, at least 2000 times. Some of the articles of this law were modified even five times a year. So there is incoherence. I don’t speak about identifying a strategic direction to which the system moves. You must have studied in school the legend of Manole, the builder, haven’t you? Well, we have been confronting the same legend for a very long time, since 1990 and whatever does one party is no longer good, and we are starting all over again, don’t we? Well, yes, but let’s kill the puppy. I told that to my colleagues: let’s kill the puppy. It must be done. To reform a system of this type you need at least two years and those years must be quiet electorally. Why? Because, all the time, the reform of a medical system means you will trouble many circles of interest and you will wake many fears. A reform of this type can be made only from two levels: president or prime minister. Period. Not other. Because if you will charge just a minister of health, another minister, from the defense will comment, the finance minister will comment, all will comment, all will complain. No This must be a top priority and I am saying it, not because I am very smart, but because this is how everyone proceeded. Margaret Thatcher – she reformed the NHS. In Germany, ages ago, Bismark did.\nObama tried to do it. So, it is done from the top, not from … Excuse me, for a healthcare reform, a health minister is just a prop. No matter who he is. Resetting Romania is now more necessary and more urgent than anytime.  The healthcare system is the first, but not the only one which needs a deep overhaul. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It is sufficient to visit any hospital, I am not saying private in the West, any similarly public hospital from the west, be it from England, be it from Germany, or France, from wherever you want, to make a comparison. I think a system closer to what we want is the one in Germany, where there are public insurance institutions and private insurance institutions, where everybody has the obligation to have public [health] insurance, some can also pay a private one, everyone can rely on the healthcare system, but those who pay extra benefit from some extra services or from better conditions during hospitalization, but, as a principle, everybody has health insurance and if you want extra services, you pay extra and get an insurance with a private insurer. I want to go, I don’t know, to a private hospital, where the staying conditions are better, maybe I benefit from a better healthcare because there are fewer patients for one physician and then, except this insurance, I pay for a complementary one which can be signed with the national public insurer, or with a private insurer. But the mechanisms must be put in place. After 1990, Romania oscillated between the desire to create a health insurance system as independent as possible and the habit of operating in a centralized model, strengthened during the communist regime. This confusion has been transmitted to society level. Many Romanians are not aware that the healthcare operates on an insurance basis, but believe that the state offers them automatically access to examinations, operations, and treatment. This is also the root of the fear that, without a state-controlled system, they will remain without medical care. The public healthcare system is sacred, we don’t have to touch it, we don’t have to compete with it. Because, dear god, if we get private the pensioners and the least advantaged will have nowhere to go. Well, in France any person, whatever their social status, can afford to go to a private clinic, because they will not pay anything. There is a 10% difference which is provided by a complementary institution, so called mutual. So, practically, neither the public, nor the private services in France are 100% free. They are free 80, 90%, for the rest you get a complementary [insurance], which can be 30, 50, 100, 200 euro/month, considering the level you want. But it is the same both for public and private insurance, and the fact that the patient must, through this financial system, to purchase a co-insurance, makes him more responsible. For us, you know that you will be treated anyway in a public hospital, you have no responsibility, you are not aware how much from your wage goes to the health insurance fund. And most of all, no one needs to care for his health through complementary insurance.  It wouldn’t be much, it would be at the level of one mandatory vehicle insurance, maybe per year. The West offers us also the model of centralized healthcare systems operating very well. In England, the medical services are free for all residents, everything being covered from the state budget. We must answer the question “what type of healthcare system do we want?” Do we want a socialist system in which we all have access to services? Worse services, but closer to our possibilities. Or a highly qualified system that doesn’t treat everyone, that from time to time selects its patients and to which those who want better services pay more. You cannot make both happy at the same time, but someone at political level must take a decision. What kind of system do we want and at the time we decide on the system and its configuration, everybody will have to keep it and develop it for at least 10, 15 years.  After that we would reach a conclusion if we have chosen well or not, and to modify it. Even after we will decide as society what kind of system we desire and we will have the politicians able to adopt of strategy and to implement it, the health reform shall not be possible without a critical mass of physicians who will ask themselves this question: Does this healthcare have any purpose? Does neurosurgery have any purpose? Does it have any meaning what I currently do? It doesn’t have any meaning. What difference does it make if you save a thousand, if you killed one?  The system forced them to convict their patients, so they chose to quit.  Two neurosurgeons from the Colentina hospital who had returned to the country from France to make a difference, have abandoned the fight. The two physicians who have quit because of the deficiencies from Colentina are those who have founded the neurosurgery clinic. In September 2017, neurosurgeons Dorin Bica and Ionut Gobej, returned to Romania after having completed their residency in the West, were quitting from the Colentina hospital, evoking reasons we are not accustomed to hearing. Out of 500 patients, our estimated yearly number of people treated, 1% die because the surgery was not properly closed. We didn’t have a wire, a surgery wire costing 10 lei. No, it costs 15 lei, it is more expensive. So 1%. This means that at the end of each year we two together have at least two, three patients on our conscience because we made this compromise. How do you feel? How would you feel? How? Please tell me. Is there any point in doing healthcare with compromises? And I shall answer now. No. No. Don’t do that because you will not sleep well at night, or you will become a monster. We don’t remember the patients who get better, ok? We always remember those who deteriorate and if it happens very often to worsen, this job of ours becomes impossible to practice. Following their resignation from Colentina, Dorin Bica and Ionut Gobej chose to stay in Romania, and they built from scratch a private neurosurgery clinic to which they added a charity for helping the young neurosurgeons to get access to training courses in the West.  Things cannot be changed immediately, in a year, five years, they are changed during generations. And this generation is apparently firmly in place and it is not only present, but it also cannot be stopped. Therefore, at Colentina, wherefrom I and my colleague left, currently, there are five neurosurgeons, others than the two of us, who were all trained in foreign lands. When you leave and come back, you burn some stages. You go, you see, you come back, and you make it happen. I left and went to one of the best places in this world. I left Romania, I went to Louisville, at Kosair Children’s Hospital and I was like a sponge, absorbing everything. And there, I saw and said “let’s go home, to make things happen” At home the water runs down the walls, there were no breathing devices, I came with devices from there. And I didn’t relent until I made things just like over there.  There are islands of reform in public hospitals too, built by people who, in their turn, refused to practice healthcare with compromise and decided to change on their own the medical system, at least in the department they worked in. How could I wish it to be, if I spend more time here than at home? I am here from dawn till dusk, so how do I want the place to be? I am bothered to see something carved on the wall, and I stop and fix it. There is no exception.  At home, the door handles might squeak, here this is not allowed.   This might sound tough, but until we understand that we are a part of the system, and we need to engage more, the hospitals will not look better. Otherwise, if we have a problem and we say: “look at this hospital” and “no one is doing anything” In the first place, you are the one who didn’t do anything. If one of my breathing devices caught fire because of an old socket, I took a picture – I photographed it, as the nephew of one of my female colleagues died like this. And I said: „We shall have the best sockets”. For me it was a project to be able to put my fingers in a socket and not to electrocute myself. Because it was happening all the time, including to myself, you can imagine, while working with all those cables in the vicinity of a child in an incubator As we had plugs, triple sockets, it was a disaster. Yes, as a doctor, as head of department, as human being, as citizen present in this place, I take a look around and ask myself from where do I start fixing things. The doctor Catalin Cirstoveanu has built at the Marie Curie hospital, one of the most modern intensive care department for newborns from Europe. He has done this with money from donations, putting himself forward more than his job description demanded.  Now, do you see this list? 12 on the waiting list. In one year and a half since we started using the app, 30 children died. 30 died, not because we didn’t provide treatment, not because we didn’t treat them properly, but because they stayed on the list, and we were not able to treat them at all. They stayed. I said this many times. As Alexandra called 112 and waited for rescuers to come and help, because she was in a critical condition. So they call us. Our colleagues call and since we have opened in January 2019, 29 children died waiting for a place, hoping for a treatment. For me, this is the project now. Do you see? I am dying because of this.   And I said, ok, we collect money through the line 8844 BINE, we ask the companies, we ask friends, yes? Whoever can… and this is what we’ll do. We want to increase with 20 more beds the facilities we have here.  I don’t want to see anyone waiting there. We will begin in a month, I hope, to build the heliport, because there were times when children died because of situations… I will remember my whole life, you know? I will not remember 1000 successful transports, I will remember the 2, 3, 5, 10 when children died in situations where something else could have been done, And I said: a heliport is needed. And you will see: we will land on the hospital very soon. Near the Marie Curie hospital, the Daruieste Viata hospital is built.  This is the giant effort of very determined people making us all confident that through direct action, the medical system might move towards good. For me, things were very firm. I am staying here for as long as I can do things. For as long as I am a physician, I shall always tell what and why doesn’t function. You shouldn’t believe that abroad everything comes from the government. I was in England when a cardiac surgery department in Leicester was being shut down and these people were saying: “We have to influence the government”. They are politicians. They get it or they don’t get it. If they don’t get it, we owe it to them to make them get it. And if they get it, we owe it to them to teach them to do it. How? We have means. Legal means... more coercive means. If they get it and they don’t want to do it, we must not abandon. Of course, there is a risk. Some of us risk with our own courage. Are we ready to risk or not to be brave?"}

A început cu activități de week-end organizate la Școala 136, unde voluntarii le ofereau copiilor meditații. Apoi a cumpărat o casă și, pe lângă meditații, a adăugat ședințe de consiliere și suport emoțional. În timp, la Casa Bună – așa cum au numit-o copiii – s-a format o comunitate și, începând din această primăvară, Valeriu Nicolae organizează tabere de o săptămână. Până la toamnă vor fi în total zece tabere, în care vor ajunge 60 de copii.\n\nAici, ei urmează un program gândit special pentru ei: studiază, fac sport și se joacă împreună. Tabăra are un program zilnic în care, pe lângă activitățile distractive, copiii participă împreună cu voluntarii la treburile zilnice ale casei. Gătesc, pun masa, fac curățenie și învață să colaboreze și să se ajute unii pe alții. „Eu mă ghidez după o chestie a lui Aristotel, care spunea că nu suntem ceea ce suntem, suntem ceea ce facem. Și dacă ai rutine de excelență atunci devii excelent,” spune Valeriu Nicolae.\n\nAm participat la prima tabără organizată de Casa Bună și am putut vedea cât de repede se adaptează copiii la această rutină în care sunt învățați să viseze și să aibă încredere în ei.\n\n---\n\nAcest material a fost realizat cu sprijinul Jysk România, care a inițiat și organizat taberele de la Casa Bună.\n\n#ContinutSponsorizat", "transcript": "One, two, three, come. One, two… Marina is missing, right? We’ll put them in the back.  Ferentari neighborhood, April, 2021 Can you hear me? Yes.  Let’s talk a little bit about the rules. We wash our hands. When? Every morning and whenever our hands get dirty. Yes?  Yes. I know you are some of the best kids, but be careful, ok? Can we take a shower? Of course, you can. Sometime around 2010, we started working with kids from… There was a day-care center around the Ferentari ghetto where parents were basically abandoning their children. And then we said, “let’s take them to our place.” And we spent every New Year's Eve, all Easter holidays, and Christmases with the kids. It was really nice. We would go out for walks with the dogs in the fields, it was really beautiful. And the children were saying “now, we’re at the good house.” “When are we going to the good house again, mister?” The Good House (“Casa Bună”) Go in the house, I’ll be there in a second. I’ll bring your stuff. Valeriu Nicolae has been taking care of children from disadvantaged families from Ferentari for the past 11 years This spring, he succeeded in organizing the first camp at the Good House. Let me see, girl. It’s like I’m in prison. Here are some clothes that you can wear around the house. Yes, they are pretty. Or outside. You like them? Yes, they're girly. I got this t-shirt, like Vali. Yes, me too. Here come children between the age of eight and fourteen. They are children from Ferentari. From the Ferentari ghetto as well as from the houses around the Ferentari ghetto. They live in really tough conditions. Very difficult families, very poor,  with a lot of violence, a lot of trash, a lot of abuse, lack of supervision, bad food. The ghetto is full of rats, junkies. It’s different. Here we have better living conditions than at home. What do you mean? Well, how can I say this? Maybe some don’t have a bathroom and here they do… They are not really used to have their personal space, privacy, and quietness. And a well-structured schedule where they have time to play and learn, some adults who only focus on them, a schedule suitable for their needs, a menu designed for them. Ok, so this is how a day will look like. \nIn the morning we wake up at eight, then  we come downstairs and prepare breakfast together, we eat together  and then around nine, ten o’clock you will be split up into two groups of three. Everyone will study with a lady. Whoever’s done first can go and play with Valeriu. What do you think? Sounds good? Yes. Yes. On one hand, this is an escape from everyday life  and maybe from the things that are harder to deal with but also a way of learning. This is what we want it to be: education and joy at the same time. Ok, act it out for Vali. Tell me! When you go to the theme park, the park. What do you ride? Rollercoaster. Yes! Good job! Wow, my coin. One thousand lei! Come on, arms up! The camp also wants to teach them to follow a schedule. Maybe this is what they need most. To have silence around them when they study. Some of them need to catch up with school work, they are some years behind. Ferentari Studios. Miss, what does innovative education mean? So, you were here. Can you please… T…e…l….l…\nM…e… Can you please tell me… Eight minus two equals what? I have eight apples and I eat two. How many are left? So, I have eight apples… And eat two. There will be eight left. So, you have eight apples, eat two, and are left with eight? Yes! I think you could invent something. If you ate two you can’t be left with eight because you ate two. How many will you have? So, we have eight fingers… Aaa, six! Aaa, six. Still counting with your fingers? I haven’t seen such kind people. They help us with our homework, for them to waste their time. The teachers are patient with me. The one from school isn’t. She would explain things to the others but to us, the Roma side, she wouldn’t. She would act differently… I don’t think they look at school with hate or concern. On the contrary, I think I succeed in making them interested in learning. The flowers were pale… And with a stained color… What does “pale” mean? Soft, like… tired. When you look at a person and you notice his face is pale, what does that mean? He’s tired. Maybe he’s sick, maybe he’s sad and it looks like his face is losing its color. It’s whiter, right?  Upset. I like that I can read and that helps me in life. How does it help? So I can have a job and make my own money. Let's see. They're cooking? And why was I not there? Are we cooking? What food? What food? We’re making potatoes in the oven. I want to do it as well. You can also help. Marina will cut them in two and then we cut them like this. Ok? Yes. In big chunks and we arrange them like this. Oops! Enjoy your meal! Thank you! Whoever eats all the salad will get eclairs! Me! Me! I will eat the salad, I will finish the whole bowl! You can tell it’s new for them to have a routine and a well-organized schedule. In the first two days, they were saying they are extremely bored, and that time passes slowly here. It was a challenge for them to keep up with this rhythm.  I believe in this thing Aristotle says that we are not who we are, but we are what we repeatedly do. If you have an excellent routine, then you become excellent.  It helps. In a very short time, the children get used to the routine.  The kids are changing their behavior. I saw some beds made flawlessly in the morning. At night they race to wash their teeth. I don’t even have to tell them anything anymore. They say: \"hey, we need to brush our teeth.\" When I wake up: “miss, come and see how I made my bed!” This will create positive associations.  So, I don’t know when we’re leaving, but I never want to leave... stay here for 50 years. If my family were here… Yes, if I were here with my family, I’d be here for one hundred years! The children who are in the camp come to the Good House regularly to get counseling and support Look at that hornet! Where? There! Where does this philanthropy come from? Out of guilt. I felt extremely guilty. I grew up very, very poor. And I remembered that a lot of people helped me throughout my life to get to where I am. Mister Valeriu is here. Oh, my God! Enjoy the meal! Thank you, thank you, mister. This is a solution not only for the children but also for communities.  What we really succeeded with was creating a community. We have a large community, hundreds of people who want to do good and we support each other. It takes a village to raise a child. These children truly have all the qualities, but when you can’t learn too much about yourself, you can’t know how far you can get. I think the camp can make them want more from life. Hip, hip, the Good House! One more time! Hip, hip, the Good House! Ok, bye-bye, I’m leaving. Are we going to do homework together on the computer and read together? Yes. See you soon. Yes. Roberta! Will we see each other this week? Let’s go! The younger ones in the back. And the older ones in the front. Hugs and kisses! How was it?  What did you like the most? I liked the food! And what else? The ball. Same! I liked everything! And who read the most? I did! \nMe too!  Yes, they were praising you for reading a lot, Marina. I also read! Did a summary too. Me too!  These are the buildings where the children live. Look, Marițu, Bubu, these are my children. It’s written on the building. This is what it looks like... Bye! Bye-bye! Thank you, mister! Bye! I’ll give you some gingerbread. You take it, this one's a bit chubby. Bye! What do you say? Thank you! Good-bye! Good-bye! In total, 60 children will spend one week in the Good House camps that were organized by Jysk Romania"}

După câțiva ani în care a îndurat și discriminarea celor din jur și trauma de a fi dat afară de la școală, Adela Hanafi s-a hotărât să deschidă „Conil”, prima grădiniță și școală incluzivă cu scopul ca absolut orice copil să fie primit cu brațele deschise.\n\n„Conil” există din 2005, acum are deja patru centre diferite, pe care Adela Hanafi le-a dezvoltat de la început după același principiu – ca pe un mediu în care diferențele nu reprezintă absolut nicio problemă, iar misiunea profesorului e să descopere ce e mai bun într-un copil.\n\nReportaj Realizat cu sprijinul Unicef\n#ContinutSponsorizat", "transcript": "\"Conil\" is the first inclusive kindergarten in Bucharest, a place where children with special needs (atypical) learn among typical children \"Conil\" was founded in 2005 by Adela Hanafi, who is herself a mother of a child with special needs Bravo Robert, give me some too! Look! Do like this. I am often asked how there can be typical children among so many children with special needs, how they parents can accept this. She is atypical, they are typical, he isn’t, he isn’t. He isn’t typical. So most of them are atypical. But you can’t tell because they are all kids. It’s an artform for the teacher to integrate them, to be able to explain to the other children what the situation is but not in terms like: “She has an illness. He is sick.”\nNo. “She needs more care right now” or I don’t know… Children understand and they are very empathic. We will talk a bit about what “night” means? The moon and the stars! The moon and the stars, really good. Andrei, so during the night, the moon shows up on the sky, right? Which one is the moon? This is the sun and this is….? Say: “Moon”! Moon. Moon. Good job! Adela Hanafi - president of the Conil Association  \n \nThe story starts with me being a student in Cairo, I wanted to earn some money so I went to work. The most welcoming place for me was a school for children with special needs. That was my first contact with special needs children. And I discovered there, that this suits me very well. And it just happened that once I was in Romania, I had my own child with special needs. Kuky was born in 1996, in a Romania that was still learning that children with disabilities have the right to be treated with care At that time, the Romanian medical system was completely unprepared for the needs of an atypical child At the time there wasn’t a lot of information available, even among doctors. They didn’t know what to do, at most they treated him with neurostimulators, he was taking spirulina, for example Or Gerovital. Only when he was six, I saw a neuropsychiatrist who sent me to do an MRI and it was clear then that he had brain damage. So, probably when I gave birth, they left him there in his little bed, he wasn’t properly taken care of, choked and that was it. I mean look, a little negligence can destroy not only the child’s life, but the whole family, because these things have consequences for the family as well. Yes, we lost valuable time then because, probably, kinesiotherapy, even when he was an infant, would have helped. One of the big challenges children with special needs face, is discrimination There is a lot of pain for a parent in this situation. From walking on the street, to going to the pastry shop or the park, people walk away when they see you. Everyone: “Get away, he is sick, get away because he’s sick!” As a parent you feel helpless. I mean this feeling – look, I’m getting goosebumps, because I know how it’s like. It’s horrible. But I wanted to take Kuky everywhere, I did not give up, even with the risk of, lets say, getting into troubles. In the end they accepted him. Let’s start! Kuky, one, two, three, go! Kuky was fascinated by music, he liked rock music. The moment he saw he was doing something extraordinary, that people were cheering for him, at school he improved massively, I couldn’t believe it. But this was because he started to be confident, he felt he can do something. How are you? I'm good. You’re good? Bravo, Nico, bravo. He goes to school, right? Andrei goes to school and Nico is here for another year. Nico, Nico, come to miss. Starting school with him was a traumatizing experience for me because I tried to sign him up for a state school but once I saw there were 35 students in a class, I realized it was inefficient and no one will be able to take care of him. They insist on the integration of children in mainstream education. Yes, it is true, that would be ideal, but not under any circumstances. In classes where there are less children. I tried to go to a private school, went there, explained the situation and they said: “Ok, no problem.” After two days they called me and told me: “We cannot handle this situation, he doesn’t want to sit down, doesn’t want to do I don’t know what.” And I said OK. After this experience, for two years I couldn’t take him to school. So he had school phobia, I didn’t know at the time this existed. Maybe they were laughing at him, I wasn't there with him. but I assume something so bad happened that he refused like that Only when he heard the word “school” he had ugly meltdowns, so there was no way I could take him for two years. He entered school when he was around eight and a half and then I decided to take him to a school for special needs, he went to a school for visually impaired. Feeling comfortable, in a safe environment, Kuky changed a lot. He learned how to write, how to read, so it was possible. There were people there who knew what to do with Kuky. What do you do during the night? We sleep. We sleep and who comes around? Santa Klaus? Nooo, Old Ene comes and the fairies come and tell us stories, right? I thought Kuky needs a lot of friends around to develop, I felt a strong need to socialize from him. It has horrible to be always alone. Eh, so then I thought it would be ideal to open a kindergarten where I will accept any type of child, this was the premise to begin with. Any ethnicity, with problems, or different religious views, I did not care about any type of discrimination. And so it started. Now, Conil has four different centres, one of them being a primary school where almost 300 typical and atypical                    children learn And that’s how I can sing. Kuky passed away on the 25th of December 2018, after          a respiratory arrest, but he had a defining role in the    \n                                               founding of the kindergarten Yes... But, he had a very big role in my life. You know... I owe this to Kuky and I hope I can do more for these children, I want to have a primary school for them as well. I would like to have the full school cycle, with highschool and professional schools. For a child who enters Conil to be able to go through education all the way until we manage to find him a job and integrate him in a safe space. I also dream about founding a music school in his memory for children with special needs, where there is no fee. These are my projects and my dreams and I hope we will succeed."}

Given that this is required, it means that politicians have interests in the forestry administration. What kind of interest… ON THE WOOD THIEVES’ TRACKS II Gurghiu Mountains, Mures county. We are in a protected area in which any tree taken down can imperil ecosystems formed along thousands of years and which are protected by European laws. In the last six months, we received reports about illegal loggings taking place in this area. We’ve been in this area many times to check what type of wood goes out of the forest. At the beginning of our research, for some days, we monitored from a car all the wood transports coming out of the forests managed by the Gurghiu Forest District. From the first night we observed some trucks which had no documents according to the monitoring app for wood transports. In these days, the police patrolling the same road noticed only one suspicious car. Our car. Good evening! What’s the occasion? Beg your pardon? What’s the occasion? I’m a tourist… Where do you work? I’m a journalist. A journalist where? Recorder. So that’s where I know you from. What is Recorder? A website. Something nice! What? Some press… volunteering, no? Our presence started to draw more attention, so on our next trip in the area we played the role of tourists camping near the forest. Here is the tent where we’ll lie in wait. For three days we monitored all the wood transports. We checked the license plates of each truck in SUMAL, the database updated in real time, whereby the Romanian state imposes the cargo declaration to all carriers of wood. At first sight, all heavy trucks were transporting wood legally; however our extended monitoring has revealed more methods through which the local companies trick the state radar. First method: the overloading. According to the law, every company that transports any quantity of wood is obliged prior to departure to register the cargo in the electronic system of the state. Automatically, the system issues a notice with the quantity and type of wood. This notice allows the truck to operate legally. The overloading method means that apart from the legally transported wood, the truck is loaded with a higher quantity than the one listed in the notice. This is the illegal wood. At the time when it was caught by our cameras, the truck loaded to the brim, has registered in the electronic system a transport of nine cubic meters in the front trailer and six cubic meters in the back. We consulted several experienced foresters and all of them estimated a total actual quantity three times bigger than the one registered. Furthermore, notices from the same truck display on other days loads of 18 and 24 cubic meters. The second method discovered through our monitoring is: multiple transports. A truck which transports wood legally will obtain a notice and for distances up to 50 kilometres he has 6 hours to carry the load to the destination. Most of the time, the tour lasts less than one hour. As such, the company that wants to take out wood illegally has enough time for another transport under to the already obtained notice. The same green, overloaded truck filmed by us, obtained a notice at 13:39. In the same day, at 19:12, we filmed the truck again doing another transport for which it didn't have a notice. 94DAP and 19DAP passed by at 19:12. This is an intensively used practice by the companies from the area. We also observed other trucks doing multiple transports using only one notice. Is there any chance that this truck drove on public roads without a notice? I don’t think so, no. Loaded? Not this truck. No? No. Maybe in March? Did you transport wood in March with this truck without a notice? No, no. Sure? Hundred percent. Without a notice… how can I drive without a notice… the police stops you.. We took pictures with the phone when you were driving without a notice. These are your tricks. How? These are your tricks, I don’t believe that. No? Show me evidence. Can you wait? I will show you. I accept This is your truck, right? Let me see. Yes, I think so. There was no notice for this truck? On 17.03 at 8:40 you had no notice. I don’t believe this. You don’t? So, there was no notice for the truck on that day? There was no notice. You modified the picture. Why would we do this? Petru Todoran is the owner of Petrycris SRL and he considers that people who own logging companies should be left alone to handle their business, without being persecuted. I see that this is the final goal: no more logging in Romanian forests. So we go to Germany. I have people, right? I have a company, I invested in machines. What should I do with them? Should I sell them for scrap and go to Germany? What can I do? You tell me. Give me an idea. No, closing the company is not an idea. Or should I film like you, to do harm? What can I do? Why? We do harm? No, I’m thinking, what can I do? Our interest is for things to work out legally in this country. Is this wrong? I know. And is it our fault that things work out like this? We continued our research in the forests of the Mures county to understand from where the wood carried out without notice comes from. We came to find out that logging companies discover methods to trick the law not only for the transport, but also for cutting down wood. We entered into a parcel in which a local company bought logging rights for small trees. According to the forestry standards, those are considered mandatory loggings contributing to the resistance of the surrounding valuable trees. In the parcel in which the logging term has already expired we found something completely different: The trees that should have been transported according to the existing documents, are on the spot – uncut. As one can see, those are thin trees, of very low quality. And now, we can’t help but wonder what kind of trees were transported instead of these. Our sources exposed another theft method which explains the mystery of the uncut trees. Those involved name it the “thinning method”. The forest relies on explicit rules of maintenance, whereas the most important silvicultural operation is removing the weakly developed trees to facilitate space for the development of good quality trees. The forest districts prepare tendering procedures for these maintenance operations, and the winning firms obtain the right to remove the thin trees and to harness them. In reality, the firms do not settle for the small and poor quality trees. As such, they often leave these trees untouched and instead they illegally remove large trees of best quality. A forest experiencing abusive loggings loses its resistance against the wind. Furthermore, this year in the forests of the Gurghiu Forest District, in a single day, the wind brought down around 150.000 trees. We went through more parcels next to Horea Petrehus, a researcher with good knowledge of the local forests. I will show you some trees which should’ve been removed but weren’t, although in the related documents they appear as transported. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, only in this perimeter. While the tree is still on the ground, the wood appears as transported by the winning firm. We want to know where the transported wood comes from. Which could be the stake? This type of practices prove me that the logging companies operating here, managed to get hold of documents for the transportation of wood from another place, from where they are not allowed to. In other words, this is illicit procurement of transportation documents for wooden material. This kind of method would be impossible to be put in place without the complicity of foresters who manage these parcels. A few months ago they wrote in the documents that the marked trees have been removed from the concerned parcels according to the thinning plan. However, things look different on site. The forester had the responsibility to come here in order to ascertain the work done by the firm. Now, what I see is that many trees which had to be removed are still here. The question is the same: where does the transported wooden material come from, when the wooden material, most of it, is still on ground? Could this operation be carried out without the acknowledgement of the Forest District? No. Why? Because this is the duty of the forester. He comes on site, has inventory documents, controls the stage of the work done by the firm, he must come to check that everything has been done in accordance with the law. But here we can deduce serious illegalities. We confronted one of the responsible foresters. Didn’t you notice the unremoved trees? I saw… a few. You saw few? There was the snow layer and… Didn’t you see all the stumps left? I cannot provide you with more details now. I understand. More details at the Forest District, because I don’t know. Another clue about the complicity of the local foresters comes from the elaboration of the inventory documents, as well as of public tender documents. The forester who did the inventory of the parcel noted an amount of 12.360 trees which fall within the thinning operations, namely – thin trees. Whilst preparing the tender, the Gurghiu Forest District drew up a document listing only 2630 trees, but with a five times larger volume. In other words, even though the parcel was full of thin trees, the winning firm had the possibility to justify the transport of much larger trees. Is this your signature? Yes. We have information that this document is forged. How come your signature is here? Do you know about this APV (evaluation report)? I’m asking you nicely to present the questions before the interview and… Well, I asked the question: is this your signature? Yes, it’s my signature. Did you approve this APV? You have a copy of an APV, we can discuss soon, please wait for 2 minutes. Can a tree of this size have a volume of 0.5 cubic meters? It can be an error, not a forgery. You can interpret this however you want, but it can also be an error. So, don’t… An error? Where is the error? The error is… At… At the number of trees. At resinous wood category, 12630 trees should have been noted, when receiving the “calculated APV” the person who entered the data omitted a 1, so the person omitted… And you approved this omission? Yes. Why? Out of error. It’s not just an error. All width indicators have been modified in comparison to the initial document which reflects what is to be found on site. The company benefiting from the error is Darion SRL. Remember the green trucks, the multiple transports and overloads monitored at the beginning of this material. They are related to the same company. Last year, at a single control the Forestry Guard discovered in the deposits of this company almost 500 cubic meters of unsourced wood, the equivalent of 20 trucks. We went to the office of this company out of the wish to find out their point of view, but the gates were locked in the middle of the day. Hello! Somebody here? Hello! I saw a lady there, she hid from us. The employees are hiding behind the hence. The whole courtyard is obstructed, so no one can see inside, but you can deduce that there is a sawmill. You can also see some thick pieces of trees. The irregularities from the Gurghiu Forest District have also been detected by the Mures Forest Department in the previous year. The engineer, Ervin Kremer, is the one who conducted the inspection. The marked trees, included in the thinning plan, of small size, let’s say about 12-14 in diameter, were left on ground and the high quality wood was illegally removed instead. So what was of low quality and dry was left in the forest, while the valuable pieces were removed. Here you can observe the thin trees left on the ground. Look, exactly the same example, the marked tree and next to it the illegally removed tree, without a mark. The very day he conducted the inspection and took pictures of the irregularities, Ervin Kremer was beaten and hospitalized. He claims that the aggressor is the forester responsible for the inspected area. He punched me, grabbed me by the neck. “I’ll beat you to death!” He hit me and so I fell. When I got up to run home, he disappeared. I asked my wife to come with me at the hospital, I was full of blood and she was scared. The forest engineer claims he was beaten up because he refused the bribe proposed by the foresters from Gurghiu. Initially, they told me not to record the irregularities found on site, to accept 3000 Lei or how much I consider suitable. There are people who believe that anything  can be bought and sold. This is their mentality, so to say. Twelve - first. Raul Moldovan is the forester whose area was inspected by Ervin Kremer. He conducted the inspection in your area? Yes, yes, yes. And he found problems? He found… I went together with him and found somewhere between… in the covered surface, between six or seven… So… …cut, unmarked stumps. So… We went together, stopped to eat, then drove him home. Wait a minute, is it customary to eat with the inspector? Well, we agreed to eat together there. What do you mean? As colleagues. We decided to stop there and eat together. We consumed three or four beers each… together with a representative of the company. He had nothing to go home with, so I drove him home. He was not forced. Do you realize how this story sounds? You drank some beers with your inspector. This is the proper context for bribery, right? Well, bribery… he was not forced to drink three-four beers. The forester has his own version of the story about the beating that brought the engineer in the hospital. He stood up angry, started to hit the door with his fists and head, he hit the door. Do you believe that he hit his head, just like that? Yes. So, you didn’t hit him? I didn’t hit him, how could I hit him? He hit the door with his head. But I… you should understand one thing: If I wanted to hit him, I wouldn’t go to his home. The version they both agree on is that at the end of the day the forester offered to drive the engineer home, using – ironically – a car of the logging company that operated in the area with irregularities. Why did you go home with the car of the logging company? They, they called for the car. I had no car to drive home with. So you had no car to drive home with? Well, I had no car, because in the morning I set out with a colleague and he wasn’t there anymore. He had an inspection in another area. But you realized that… you are aware that it’s not right to go home with the car of the company you just inspected. I had nothing else to go home with. The company referred to is named Lupu Trans and is responsible of massive loggings in the area. The trucks owned by the company can be observed transporting best quality wood regularly. We are following this truck. According to the evidence found on the internet, this transport has documents for the loaded cargo. But what caught my attention is the tremendously large width of the carried trees. We follow to see the place where the truck will arrive. Shortly afterwards, the truck driver notices that he is followed and pulls over simulating problems with the tires. Let’s talk to him, yes… Hello. My name is Alex Nedea, from Recorder. Are you the owner? No. No? Are you the driver? Yes, yes. Why did you stop? I got two flat tires and want to check them. I changed the tire because I had a flat tire and I’m afraid… What’s wrong with the truck? You said you have two flat tires. Yes, yes, it’s visible. Why? Look at this tire and at the other one, I just changed them. He doesn’t want us to see where the wood is carried. Look at this secular resinous wood taken down by the wind or by man, it depends. The problems with the tires are so serious that, in only a few minutes, the owner of Lupu Trans arrives at the location. He claims that in his truck are only trees that were taken down by the wind. Are you saying that this secular tree was taken down by the wind or by man? Yes, there are many blown down trees, I can show you some on my phone… By wind or by man? But many trees were blown down because of a strong wind that came from Lunca Bradului over here. You can go on site to see the blown down trees. We saw, but we didn’t see such large pieces. But did you see the rotten ones, the firewood? We saw, yes. So, you saw. I sort it. I sort it by size. But this kind of pieces, I never saw such a thick tree. You know how it goes?  Strong winds sweep off everything in front of their way. So when… Including this tree that lasted for 120 years? Yes, everything. Incredible! I’m telling you. The wind blows down everything. So… Everything… The wind. A report from Mures Forest Department reveals that in the previous year Lupu Trans transported much thicker wood than it had the right to - all this on account of unperformed thinning procedures. The Forestry Guard confirmed the irregularities and they found, in the concerned parcel, almost 700 thin marked trees left on ground and at the same time 65 trees removed with no right. I want to ask you why the marked trees were found on ground when documents show that the wood has been transported. I cannot answer. No?\nNo. Aren’t you… Yes, but I have a foreman who is in charge of the loggings. Inspections have been made. Is this a method: to leave the wood on ground in order to transport from another area? No, no, no, I don’t know how you know that. No? It’s not possible? No. I understood there is this method: to get hold of documents… Probably, I don’t know from where you heard this, but I have no idea about such things. So you don’t do this?\nNo, no, no. Why were unmarked stumps found in the parcel in which you were responsible for logging? So the unmarked stumps was in fact rotten wood, already blown down. When the boys went there with the TAF (logging machine), they cut them, pushed them away to be able to remove the thin trees; or with the horses, or with whatever they worked with. There was the stump, next to it the wood. We saw some pictures with a thin marked tree… Which was still there. It was there… and next to it a stump of a healthy tree – cut down. So I don’t know what information you have… I saw pictures from the field, that’s why I’m telling you. So, I don’t know what information you have, but believe me it’s not true… Isn’t it? No. I saw the picture, I mean… I don’t know where you saw the picture, honestly. In the last month, the Mures Forest Department discovered new irregularities in the forests belonging to Gurghiu Forest District perpetrated through the “thinning method”. As such, the Forestry Guard was notified. The inspection was conducted exactly when we were in the area. Ten-fourth. Those from the Forestry Guard started counting the uncut marked trees. They already reached more than 1000 trees and they just began. A few hours ago. The final report reveals more than 4.400 thin trees left on ground. All evidence shows that instead of them, approximately 350 cubic meters of superior quality wood left the forest. Ilie Covrig, director of the Mures Forest Department, has doubts as regards the correctness of the inspection, at which, in some weird way, the addressed foresters took part. After the inspection of the Forestry Guard I was announced that data from the field has been faked, in the sense that the trees have consistently been undersized. Practically, the diameter of the trees was modified. The undersizing that Ilie Covrig is talking about, refers to the fact that in the report issued by the Forestry Guard, a significant part of the trees are either of same size or thinner than they were 4 years ago at the last measurement. In the inventory from 2016 there were only trees of 8 centimetres or bigger. The smallest trees had a diameter of 8. Four years have passed from 2016 until 2020 and, logically, the trees should now have bigger diameters. In the document from today’s inventory we can observe more than 250 new trees with a diameter of 6 centimetres. Six (centimetres)? Eight… six (centimetres)? Six AP. Number? What number did you say? Six AP. This means that a part of the team responsible with the measurements undersized the trees. Have you ever heard of a tree reducing its size in four years? I never heard this until now. The influence of those operating illegal loggings in the forests of Gurghiu Mountains is so big that a Forest Department director – namely the man coordinating the forests of the county – sees his position threatened when disturbing these networks. I was… I was advised to step aside. It’s about people who are currently in power. In power where? In the Parliament, in the Government? At the National Forestry Authority? At the ministry. People in power at the ministry told you to step aside? Well…\nThey asked the general director to clarify this to me: that I should step aside. Given that this is required, it means that politicians have interests in the forestry administration. What kind of interest… What interest? Probably they occur… I don’t know, problems of campaign support related to illicit activities. It is mindboggling to hear a Forest Department director thinking about such a theory. Yes, it’s sad that we are here after 30 years. Ilie Covrig competed for his position, which means his dismissal without concrete reasons would be illegal. Three weeks after this interview, he received an ultimatum asking him to leave the office on his own free will. After the refusal, the director of Romsilva was called to the Ministry of Environment. Recorder sources argue that he was told to find an urgent solution to remove Ilie Covrig. The Minister denies making such a command. When this material was published, Ilie Covrig was still in office."}

We found dangerous bacteria in the water, even in the local high school. Now? When we took the samples, yes. Give us a copy, so that we take some measures. What measures? We will see... Recorder found tens of villages where dangerous drinking water gets into people's homes because of shady business practices by the local administration. The local administrations did this without having the mandatory sanitary aproval. This means that the water in these villages is not tested regularly by any state authority. and Public Health does not monitor them in any way. In most cases people are not informed that the water they are drinking is contaminated with dangerous substances. We went in two villages from two different regions of Romania where such irregularities happen. We cook, we bathe, we have baths, we have toilets Did no one tell you that the water is not drinkable? How come? We have our guy in the village who puts all his effort into this. In Strejești, Olt county, the well that feeds the water suplly was dug near the cemetery. To make it better, on the water station there is a cross. A foreigner would believe the water building is part of the cemtery. So, on the right, there is the cemtery And behind you, there is the water station. The water station, yes. The water station... near the cemetery. Whoever designed this... Here they found water. From under the dead? They found water under the dead. Even so, the people are convinced that the water is drinkable. It's not willow, nor bitter, it has a good taste, it has a.... just like mineral water. It washes so well, I wash myself only with water and homemade soap. Is that it? Yes I don't use detergent nor shampoo when I wash my head. She washes herself with simple water, bravo! Plain water and soap and it's \"colărie\" What? The head, it gets clean and the body, but.... What does \"colărie\" mean? Clean! The water is very, very good. I have a nephew, when I give him water, he makes like this because of the water. And may I die if I don't give him water only from this faucet. From the National Institute for Research and Development Ecoind from Bucharest. we brought an expert to test the water. The locals don't know that the water doesn't have approval, but they are convinced it is drinkable and try to demonstrate it. Give me a mug! Behave yourself! Give me a mug! I will drink from it! What? Will I get poisoned? Look, I will drink straight from this goddamned hose, Wait, I'll give you a mug! Look! Look! Give me the... you didn't bring me a mug? Shall I drink more so you can see? How does it taste like? It's good! The lab results show us quite the contrary. The ammonia in the water is 5 times greater than the legal limit According to a report by the World Health Organization the presence of ammonia in the water indicates contamination of fecal origin. We came back to Strejești with the lab results and went to the mayor for explanations. In the middle of the day the hall is empty. The only office clerk we found sent us the water guys. I want to speak to someone about the drinkable water in the village. Someone responsible for it. There are the guys that handle the water, expecially the water, but... Where are they? I'm Alex Nedea, from Recorder. Yes, please. You are in charge of the water, right? We are just employees, we are not in charge of anything, I'm not an administrator. But you are the ones that manage the water supply, don't you? Somewhat. Somewhat, yes? Yes. I want to ask you a few questions about how drinkable the water is. Yes, but first you have to ask for my consent if I want to be filmed or not. The guy from the hall, from public relations, told me that you are the ones fit to give me some.... We are fit to give you explanations, yes. But first you should have asked for my consent... I'm on public domain and I speak to a representative of a public institution. I want to ask you if the water is drinkable? The papers say the water isn't drinkable. The people know. They have been informed that the water is not drinkable. Yes? It's like... mineral water. Really good! And the water is drinkable. The water is drinkable, that's what you know? Yes, I have a house here in the village and I drink water from the grid. I'll drink water from this goddamned hose. Wait, I'll bring you a mug Look! We haven't found one person in the village that knows that the water isn't drinkable. They were informed. To rid themselves of any responsibility, the hall and the mayor gave the water grid management to a company from the village Managed by two employees paid minimum wage. Are you the administrator? No, no, no. He's a plumber, I'm a cashier. Are you the ones that manage the Strejești water grid? Yes. Relaitve! The company that manages the water grid does not have the sanitary operating permit because the whole thing has been a disaster from the beginning. Why doesn't it work? You have a water treatment station. Yes, it works. If the water from the well doesn't allow us?!... It's how it was made from the beginning. Simply, anything that gets extracted from down there just isn't OK. But the situation in Strejești is not alone. An internal document of Public Health that we got a hold of shows a disaster across the whole county. Last year in Olt county there were 42 water grids without sanitary approval that distributed water to the population. We went to the Olt Public Health HQ, where we realized that this institution is overwhelmed by problems. It broke... Someone was stuck in there. The door broke? It broke, but I can't do much about it. After a few minutes, we were sent to another department. You go to the other side, to our Headquarters, there is the Environmental Hygiene and all... There is the epidemiologist that can tell you... At the other HQ of Public Health, the problems are even bigger. We are in the Olt Public Health building. The people here walk around town and give out fines to companies for unsanitary conditions in the workplace, and then they come back here. Look how the Public Health HQ looks like, Look how dirty the floor is! Holes in the wall.. Even though we had established an intervew with the representative of the instiution, we were sent from one door to another, until we were told that the interview wasn't going to take place. I'm not OK with being filmed... Because you came without notice... I was preparing the material for Wednesday, that's when i was told the interview would take place. No, why Wednesday? I don't know. We called on Friday, we talked to the manager, I'll show you the message. No one announced me. What data can I give you now, this fast? Tell us, are there grids that... We don't even have recent data... Finally, we got the manager of Olt Public Health on the phone, Who told us he can't do anything about the rogue water grids. I know that, according to the Law, Public Health should have shut down those grids and I want to ask you why are they now closed? No, I know that according to the Law, we can't close them. We told people about that, we told the local authorities about that and it's their duty to close them down. And how can you close restaurants, if you find public health violations? And you can't close water grids that violate public health? They are two different things. The situation in Old county can be observed in tens of counties in the country. We went to Dobrogea, Deleni village, Constanța county, where the water grid was modernized 10 years ago. Since then, the local administration hasn't solicited sanitary approval and refuses any monitoring from Public Health. The water grid still belongs to the Deleni hall and is managed by a company in insolvency. The authorities don't know what kind of water there is at Deleni for years, so we took water samples. How is the water? Is it good? Good! My kids from Constanta come here to get water They come with jugs, because the water in Constanța is with chlorine in it, and they don't like it. And when they come, they take 10L jugs and get water. It's good, you don't get tired of drinking it. It's almost like mineral water... Yes? Only it has other properties, it doesn't spray acid, like steam does. (nonsense from this guy) But the water is good. We took samples from the local high school. The lab results show us the presence of bacteria that could inflict dangerous diseases. So we went back to Deleni, to inform the people that we took samples from about it. We found some dangerous bacteria in the water. We found E.coli in the water. It may be, but they disinfect it.... what do I know? In the past, don't you remember having stomach aches, diarrhea, and not know the cause? It happens sometimes, but we don't know that, we suspect it's from the food, from other things What can you do? This is our water, we don't have another supply of it. You'll drink this? Of course, there isn't any better alternative. You can't afford to buy bottled water? No! I can't afford it. We came with the results. We found coliform bacteria in the tap waer. (School principal) Yes, they are dangerous bacteria. Yes, this you will have to discuss with the mayor. it's not the school's fault. But did you know that the water is contaminated? No, I didn't. You knew the school bathroom water was drinkable? We found nitrates three times over the legal limit. Yes, we as a school, as an institution there's nothing we can do, we can't modify the quality of the water. That's true, but did you inform the children that the water isn't drinkable? Or you didn't announce it because you didn't know? I didn't know, the kids drink the same water at home. We went to the Deleni mayor for explanations. The lab results from the samples of water here show that... we have found fecal bacteria in the water. We found dangerous bacteria in the water, including in the local high school. Now? When we took the samples, yes. We didn't have, these were probably sent to.... No, they took the samples, I know they did. Give us a copy, so that we take some measures. What measures? To see if it's good... What was found specifically, bacteria? Coliform bacteria. We found E.coli bacteria in a local man's water supply. Give us a copy... We even took samples from the local high school, you know it. And we found coliform bacteria in the water. These are bacteria that don't belong in the drinking water that children consume. Yes, we'll put filters. The people in the village don't know what they are drinking. Yes, they know. People have known that for 10 years... From when that well was dug, from around 2007-2008 Even you didn't know that there were bacteria in the water! I didn't know there were bacteria, yes, because at every check-up, there were only nitrates, not bacteria. That's why I'm surprised, because I didn't know he had living things in the water! Apart from coliform bacteria and E.coli being found in the Deleni water grid, there was a huge concentration of nitrates 4 times greater than the legal limit. Nitrates are very dangerous, especially for newborns, causing even death. In 2015, two infants in Dolj county died, and all the clues point their cause of death to the water they drank. (The mother) They drank soup with powdered milk, I gave them that and meanwhile there was my nephew near them that called me and told me there is something wrong with my girl. Her head went limp and then my other child began turning blue. We have her first aid for 45 minutes before a helicopter came... Acute intoxication, especially in newborns, leads to death. It can be that violent from water? Yes, yes, yes.. The same thing happened to them a month ago, they turned blue.. They almost died. What did the doctors say? They said it was because of the water. Nitrate intoxication, because of the water. Nitrates in the water inflict a disease that, in the case of newborns, blocks the transport of oxygen in the blood. These substances cannot be neutralized thorugh boiling. At Deleni we found mothers that continue to feed their children with water from the rogue water grid, without knowing that it is contaminated with nitrates in a concentration 4 times the legal limit. You give him milk with water? With this water... but I boil it first. With tap water? Did someone tell you that this water contains nitrates? Did someone tell you that this water is dangerous for newborns? No, no one told me. No one told you? It is dangerous to give him this tap water. I didn't know. Didn't the mayor ever tell you that the water is not drinkable? No, he didn't. It's dangerous for children, it can inflict a disease called the blue baby disease. He didn't tell me.

I go from here with my bicycle, to the train station I leave my bike at a friend's garden, \nthen I take the train and go to Bucharest I go there where I have the other bike at the Mc., tied up And from there, I start my activities My name is Florescu Daniel, and I am soon turning 47 My work, currently, is delivering food on the bycicle I commute long distance daily I ride from 40 kilometers close to Bălteni, Conțești, Dâmbovița But, really, it doesn't bother me. With this panedmic, it was a lot more work to be done because everyone was locked in their homes, with no option to go out We took risks doing this, to be frank,\nbut someone has to do this type of work. My duty to my children calls to me I have my own kids to grow and I need to give them a meal, I have to fight for our day to day lives Let's go, the train is coming Good day to you! Before becoming a deliveryman, I was a typographist, a security guard, an unqalified construction worker It didn't stick with me Until I found this delivery business I like it because I like to roam, to walk, to meet new people, to socialize It's a good job. And you earn enough, from month to month? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... Daniel has 4 children Daniel has 4 children.\nHe raises two of them by himself. And your kids, how old are they? Well, the little one is 7 years old, the girl is 11 years, and I have the other two which are 20 and 21, respectively. He would like his oldest son to follow in his footsteps as a deliveryman With my oldest son, I went to the city by car one Saturday, since the traffic was lighter \"Come on, son, let's do deliveries. Look, just follow me.\" And yeah, he liked doing that, he wanted to do it again But he didn't, since he was a beginner as a driver And he was afraid that he was... So I said: \"Don't worry, you'll get more experience\", with hopes he'll want to try it again in the future I have a feeling he will like it.\nI think he will... He can't stay in one place. Just like his dad. Whatever God wishes.\nNow... I just hope he will be healthy. I deliver a lot of food from the Mc. From McDonald's, from KFC, here, from Subway, here, from Cartofisserie \n(fried potato Romanian fastfood chain) Daniel's earning are directly proportional with the number of orders that he delivers Well, in one day you can go up to 100-150 lei\n(about 20-30 EUR, or 23-35 USD) It's worth it because I can travel 40 kilometers and afford to do this commute Even if it's tiresome to travel by train, I think it's worth it Hey there! In recent years, being a delliveryman became accesible even to those who do not know their way around Bucharest Technology is now much more advanced than it was back in the days Before, when I was a courier for a company, I had a walkie-talkie, like CFR \n(Romanian trainway lines), \"383, Roger!\" Not anymore. It's much easier and I'm really glad this technology advanced this much. I received an order! Dorobanți Way 56, Dose Cafe latte 300ml, flat white 240 ml. Good.\nOnline payment, let's go pick it up. Today's work schedule is from 10:00 to 13:30 Not everything is perfect. Like when you struggle to deliver an order and the client's not home... It bothers me that there are no bike tracks in the city, bikers are not respected in traffic. The traffic... is hell. Oh-oh! Wait, there's an accident here. What did you do, man? Daniel travels 50 kilometers all around Bucharest in just a few hours Two orders... Accepted. Ok, let's go get them. Before, there was no map app, we looked for the address in the \"Yellow Pages\" or searched in the street guide, \"Damn, where's that? Let's go there\".\nAnd if you got messed up, you checked the map again. There are also people...\nYou wouldn't believe they would do such a thing... I went to a delievery, placed my bike at the entrance,\nI said to myself \"I don't need to lock it, the client just called me and I am just one door away from the bike\". I delivered the order\nand when I went outside, my bike was gone. I'm done for today. I ran around all day. I went to deliver an order from an Italian restaurant. But I wasn't allowed to access the building to the 7th floor, and the client didn't answer the phone, I called him twice, a third time, sent him a SMS,\nhe didn't reply, and the order got cancelled So I got myself a free meal, to put it like that. I don't even know what it's inside, I really didn't look...\nI don't pay attention to what's inside. Pollo soup... di pollo.. I don't know. Do I look like I know what food this is?\nI don't. I don't eat from Italian restaurants,\nI eat our own traditional soups. But look, now we'll give Italian food a chance. What do you do when you go home? Well, first of all, I give my kids a big hug. Then, I ask them what they ate that day. This morning I placed a pot \nwith bean soup on the cooker. My girl \"ordered\" a bean soup. So I go on, I cook the food, I get ready... I take a bath. And before I know it, it's night time.\nAnd tomorrow, I start all over again. And isn't it complicated to commute, daily? I don't know. \nMaybe it is for someone who doesn't like to work. But I'm OK, I like what I do. I really do. (English subtitle made by Lupuleasa)"}

Sometimes the internet coverage is bad. It is almost time to start. The 7th grade has already messaged to say they're good to go.             Hello, Luciana! Hello! I can't hear you. Luciana, can you hear me now? I hear you poorly. Maybe it's because of the internet connection. Yeah, yeah, maybe we can sort it out. Have you heard anything from Veronica? About why she can't connect? I see that she's trying to join the call, but... Valentina, you're from Buiesti (town).\nHave you heard anything from Veronica? I think she doesn't have signal, as far as I know she came here, to Buiesti. We're 7... Rather few. Let's see, until we all get back up to speed... Here in Albesti we have kids from 3 different locations. In the Albesti school we have kids from Buiesti, Marsilieni and even from here, from Albesti. The ones from Buiesti and Marsilieni are indeed facing some series problems. We have really good kids who use the WhatsApp group, and while the class is ongoing, they tell me they have problems connecting or any other issues. It's very difficult to think that you can maintain the quality of education... while you have nothing to work with.\nHow? Using what? With no internet / signal coverage? Who wants to read the task out loud for us?\nLet's have someone read it, and let's hear a solution for it while we're at it. Second... The second source, from page 71... The second task. \"Compare the situation of women...\" \"Compare the situation of women during the first years of...\" We hear you very poorly, Luciana. Luciana, try not to move... ... so I and your classmates can hear you.. Please... Yes... We can't hear you... We're having issues with the reception again. Luciana, if you can hear me very well... ... please allow me to read the task for everyone to hear, because we hear you very poorly and I'm afraid your classmates won't understand otherwise. \"Compare the situation of women in the post-war era...\" According to the Ministry of Education, 90% of the kids in schools in Romania have access to technology. But there are no statistics about the quality of the online education offered in the country. Thank you for today,\nsee you next time, okay? We have Social Education next, okay? First, 10 minutes break so you can catch your breath. Okay. See you! See you! Goodbye! See you! Bye! This is it. And that's... what a Zoom class looks like. I don't want to think about\nwhat could happen in the autumn if we would still need to hold class online... forever... I don't know... To be honest, I hope they come up\nwith the vaccine faster... sincerely... So you grew up here? Yes, yes, yes, I grew up here. I went to school here. My former teachers, who are now retired, were my colleagues as well. How are you teaching your class online? I split the kids into groups... Some of them chose to use Zoom, but some can't access Zoom, and\nso we use Messenger's video option. And so sometimes their internet is down, other times mine is down, since I have to connect as well... It is what it is.. I didn't think it would be like this, but, we're getting used to it. Hello! Hi, Andrei! You're in kindergarten, aren't you? What's your name? Stefan. They've never been able to connect to the (online) video. Because of the poor coverage, right? \nBecause of the coverage, as well as... ... I am not always at home due to work so when I get back I check their homework and we work on that a bit, mostly in the evenings. We check Messenger, we study for a while... Now it's difficult to log into classes \nbecause I don't have a device Do you log into online classes? Why? I don't have a smartphone. It's very difficult for 6 kids\nto use one smartphone and to keep them involved in\nonline schooling, it's very difficult I can barely handle 2 of them\nwho are first graders. I think it would be different if the teacher \nwould work with them in groups, with other kids and teachers in a group. I suppose it'd be better, the teachers\ncould explain more, but... But what can I do? I only graduated up to 6th grade. We can't access anything as we don't have smartphones. He did some homework, but... She can't access for her son.. I can't as we don't have one of those phones... Smartphone? Yes I told him to visit his colleagues,\ncollect his homework from Maria. Yes, yes, from Maria. Yeah, she goes to Maria to get her homework from time to time. My oldest son has a smartphone,\nbut he's away, working as a shepherd. He comes home every 2-3 days\nand we can't wait that much time. So the only phone available in the family...\nYes, yes, my son's phone. Yes, he's the only one with a smartphone. Most of the time, the phone belongs to the parents... and if we consider that in the rural areas\nthe parents are busy in the mornings, doing different chores, taking care of their animals,\nthen the problems arise in the moment when there are more kids in the same family. Parents are basically forced to choose\nwhich one gets the phone Village: Bratilesti\nCounty: Buzau Hello! Our kids come to school from very far away There are kids who live on the tip of the mountain,\nvery far away as here is a mountainous area.\nAnd it is very difficult to get there. So these kids can't log in online cause\nit's impossible for them. So for the past 2-3 months,\nsince the pandemic has started, they've not been in touch with the school or education? For some of them this is true We don't have internet connection. We don't have it.. We are poor and we can't afford it at the moment What are the kids doing?\nThey're not getting any education It is what it is now, they'll go back when they can. Are you getting online schooling on your smartphone? No, sir, how? If they don't give us anything.\nThey're selfish. They don't give us anything from school.\nAnd we can't go anymore. They closed the school as\nwe are dealing with a disease. What is your plan if the school is going\nto be online from now on? We didn't go to school so our kids won't go either That is exactly what I wanted to say The ones from poorer areas were being\nencouraged to come to school, and they were feeling supported by the school. The teacher, the student and the family\nwere a strong group of three, which had a positive impact on the education\nand the development of the kid. If they already have a grade,\nit is easier for us to decide the overall mark. If they don't have any grade, we check\nthe first semester's overall mark What are you doing with these? They send me the pictures, I check their homework\nand I send back the feedback, if they got something wrong. Let me find another example. This is it. I highlight their mistakes Circled, underlined.. with the correct form You are one of the younger teachers,\nhow are the older ones doing? They ask us for help or they just retire. I have been working for 45 years in the system I made a group, the younger teachers\ntaught me how to upload materials. The younger teachers jumped in to help me\nand created a Facebook profile for me. And I got used to it. Can you go on Facebook now and show us around? No, I can't use it on a computer. You don't know how to use it on a computer, do you? Only on the smartphone. Yes. How are you doing, Darius? Good, how are you? I've come to see how you are. How is the online school going? It was better when we were going to school,\nbut we're doing our best. Look! Wait, it takes long to connect. I finished the Math class approximately half an hour ago Did you understand everything? It's difficult to understand,\nthe connection often breaks down. The Math class is the only one you do online? Yes. How are you dealing with other subjects? On the online platform (most likely they are referring to Google Classroom), they send us the materials\nand what we have to do What about classes like Sports?\nIs something going for those? We are doing something.. What? Our teacher sends us videos to do the exercises. Most of us don't check them anymore. \"Hello!\" \"I'd like to invite you to do\nsome exercises together at home\" \"because the situation is like this,\nwe must stay at home and nobody likes that\" When are you having your first exam\nfor getting into high school? Soon? On the 15th. I need to... study a bit more. This is the only thing that would make me happy: if they go away and make something out of their life. I wasn't able to. I was smart. But I lived  in different times.\nI finished only 5 years of education. I will regret that my whole life. And you want something better for them? I want something much better for them. It is the only thing we fight for,\nwe want them to do more in life. To go to school. Video made by Recorder.

You start picking up\npeople and parcels. We set off in the evening. On Friday morning or around midday,\ndepending on the route, you reach the UK. You drop off the parcels, the people... More and more people\nare emigrating. A lot of firms in my town go all over Europe,\nnot just to England. Some go to Sweden, Denmark...\nAll over. The vans are always full. The weirdest thing is...\nWell, you can't describe the feeling. When you take people away from\ntheir elderly grandparents or parents... ...grandchildren, children,\nand they're all in tears, I dunno... You feel it.\nIt has an impact on you. So many are emigrating.\nI didn't want to, Andrei. 99.9% of Romanians\nsay they make money. You do make money. But at the end of the day, it's not worth it. You'll have no time at all\nfor your family or anything else. I've nearly reached London,\nI'll be there in 45 minutes. Then I'll head over there. Country veg,\nand fruit. Romanians keep asking\nfor Romanian food. They don't like Chinese food,\nespecially stuff from warehouses. They demand Romanian food. We try to get it in.\nLike today: garlic, onions, potatoes. All the other shops\nsell Chinese stuff. We try to get them Romanian food\nso they feel at home. Just food,\nwe can't bring other stuff over.

Three nights one week,\nfour nights the next. And so on. - We've been working nights.\n- We work at night. If we take leave,\nwe go to Romania. Just when necessary. But I think we've been lucky,\nbecause we haven't been... There are probably\nother Romanians in England who live ten to a house\nwith three rooms. Here, it's just the two of us,\nand next week... - Three.\n- The baby. I think I'm so used to it here,\nI don't notice the difference now between how life was in Romania\nand what it's like here. So this is my home. You go to work,\nyou come home, family... If you get any free time,\nyou see friends... We're used to seeing each other\nonce a year. Here's the potion. The best potion. Wine?

Good,\nthanks ever so much, love! My pleasure!\nAll the best! - Bye!\n- Take care, bye! Take care, bye! I miss her,\nbut... Sometimes I feel sad\nthat she's on her own at home, and ill. I asked her if she wanted me home.\nWhat'll I do at home? I have a good life here. I'm doing well,\nthank the Lord. Compared with Romania,\nI think... ...you can afford\nlots of things. What do you want\nfor your baby? That he'll grow up like a Romanian,\nlike me. With the life of an Englishman,\nbut the heart of a Romanian. 400,000 Romanians live in the UK.

I really believe it was a rebirth, because, overnight, we stepped into\na new world which had different rules. You could speak freely, you had hope. Freedom! Ceausescu, the criminal! Ceausescu - kaput! History is sometimes a pot that\nboils over and blows the lid off. And, after 40 years of what we lived with, the idea that, for the first time in\nmy life, I was a free man made me dizzy like I was drunk.\nThe drunkenness of freedom. It was a sort of... A reaction to freedom, I mean... Finally, we can do anything. Without any\nworries, like some teenagers. Freedom! Freedom! There is a God! There is a God! There was an immense feeling of liberation and we all had this feeling that\nfrom this moment on we can do anything, we can tear down\nmountains, change everything. We were like kids who were\nnot allowed to go to parties and the first party they go to,\nthey get drunk and go crazy. That's kind of how we were after Ceausescu fell. During those days there was this feeling that,\ntogether, we were part of an ideal. Things are getting better and better. Let's rejoice, happy days are coming. After 45 years of communism, Romanians were discovering a feeling that\nmany never experienced before: freedom. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Very few Romanians knew in 1990\nwhat freedom means. How many in this country really knew that\nfreedom is not something that can be given? You either take it yourself,\nor you will never have it. The Romanian revolution was a great liberation,\nbut it didn't solve everything overnight. In 1990, Romanians were setting off on a long\njourney during which they'd discover just how difficult it is to build\na democratic society. Freedom is a burden that many want to be rid of. Once they have it they don't\nknow what to do with it. That was 1990. Romanians were saying:\n\"There's just too much freedom!\" Too much freedom! Chapter 1\nThe burden of freedom We want... We want to be left alone,\nto live peacefully and to work. To have decent and honest jobs. Those who came from abroad should go back! If these people come and buy the factories and\nstart producing an excess, I'll tell you, we'll end up on the streets! That's what\nwill become of us! Us, Romanians! The dawn of democracy found\nRomanians still in the streets, gathered in city squares, discovering\nthe joy of being able to speak freely. But doubt was born from these debates\nand freedom began to be a burden. I was working in a factory in the 90s,\nlike everyone else, and I remember thinking... \"What am I going to do?\"? Will these\nfactories keep running? Are they going to close?\" \"Will my skills be in demand?\" And are they going to bring in Westerners\nto work in your institutions? They're not bringing anyone in.\nIt's all machines now. If they want to keep you on, they will.\nIf not, you're fired! You're fired! They'll fire you! They'll be on the French Riviera\nand you'll be a no-one! Overnight, all the landmarks were gone. And, of course, everyone was confused. Nature can't sustain a void and\npeople need something to strive for and someone needs to point them to it. What else could've come out of it? What could possibly come out of this vacuum,\nbut the pseudo-landmark that was Ion Iliescu. We're determined to do everything we\ncan to deliver on our commitments... Ion Iliescu was the man who on Dec 22nd 1989 posed as the\nleader of the revolution, and assumed country leadership. The country will be now known as 'Romania'! Through the chaos and confusion at the time,\npeople saw him as a saviour. ION ILIESCU\nWE TRUST HIM The entire country would wait\nfor Ion Iliescu to come on TV and tell them what will happen with Romania. I'm open to all dialogue. And this was in essence Ion Iliescu's role:\nhe provided society with the landmarks. I was 25 at the time of the revolution,\nand I liked him. because I felt he sounded sophisticated and educated. The National Salvation Front, emerged\nfrom the Romanian Revolution in December and guarantees this country's\nfreedom, peace, and security. And every worker in our factory was a\nFSN (National Salvation Front) and Iliescu die-hard , \"he will defend us against the\nbourgeoisie who comes to take our jobs\" This was you'd hear everywhere. 21st - 22nd, Iliescu was with us! After a revolution which claimed over a thousand\ndeaths in the name of freedom from communism, people's fondness of Iliescu seemed incomprehensible. The man whose name they were chanting\ncame from the frontline of the Communist Party. Please prepare for the arrival\nof our country's flag! Three colours I know in the world Which I hold so dear and holy He was someone capable of reshuffling\nthe former communist structures in a way that they would resemble an\noriginal democracy, as he would call it, and he posed as a progressive figure,\nin relation to the party secretaries, or with Ceausescu and old-school communistists He seemed the person to embody\nthe Romanian society's ideal at the time: a Gorbachev-style reform of communism. I received a call from Moscow,\nfrom president Gorbachev. We agreed that relationships between our countries\nneed to develop on a new, healthy foundation. FSN, FSN go back to USSR! There were, however, Romanians who wished\nthe country would cut its communist ties for good and implement a Western democracy. Out with communism! Out with communism! Out with communism! I was the school leader at the time, so I thought we would organise a protest to say: \"Wait a minute, we want an actual change, not a half-change, where people in charge\nare former communist party apparatchiks.\" Ceausescu, don't be sad, Iliescu's a communist! Ceausescu, don't be sad, Iliescu's a communist! In the spring of 1990, those\nchallenging Ion Iliescu's legitimacy started to gather every night\nin the Bucharest city centre. This gave birth to the \"University Square\"\nphenomenon. I went to bed with Ceausescu in charge When I woke up it was Iliescu And the fact their names rhyme\nis not a coincidence The purpose of this protest is to fight and oppose all forms of communism. No one asked for anything terrible\nlike trials, death penalties and things like that. The ask was simple: Those who built communism\nshouldn't be teaching us about living in a democracy. The 'Square' demanded: First, members of Security (secret police)\nto be banned from politics. Sadly that never happened. On this issue, the protesters were right. They also demanded that former communist\nofficials shouldn't be frontbenchers. And, of course, this was\ntoo a reasonable request. But in 1990, the demands from the 'Square' were\nignored by the country's provisional leadership. There are those who take pity on the\nhooligans causing trouble in the city centre. The 'University Square phenomenon' highlighted\nthe divide in Romanian society. Only months after marching united\nagainst a communist dictatorship, those in the square chanting 'Out with communism!'\nwere now painted as hooligans. Yes, of course! I went to the\nsquare together with mum and dad. This, in fact, led to us\nfalling out with my godparents. Because, every time we visited them,\nthey'd say: You shouldn't be there, they're just bums\nand drug addicts. There's sexual abominations\nand who knows what else... But we were in the square and\nknew what was going on. It was staggering that a couple of\nintellectuals would say such things. I remember my dad got upset and said:\nThat's it, we're not going to visit them anymore. And we've never spoken to them since. I'd rather be a bum than an apparatchik. I'd rather be dead than a communist! What upset a lot of people were those dreadful\nthings you'd hear from University Square. Like \"I'd rather be dead than a communist\" There were 4 million party members.\nCan you imagine? Every one of them was wondering: What's this? Do you mean to erase our whole lives? There were millions who in the 50s, 60s, and 70s,\nhad gone through urbanization. They were taken haphazardly from villages\nand forced to work in factories. They'd live in a flat for the first time in their lives.\nHad a fridge for the first time. Had a TV and a radio for the first time. And for most of them there was never\nanything else but communism. If you were 44 or younger, you knew nothing but\ncommunism for your whole life. That was their life! That's where they lived and worked,\naccomplished things, had children. So that's what it was about. Chapter 2:\n\"We won at the revolution,\nlet's win at democracy\" Dear viewers, in the next two hours,\nthe guests in our studio are the three presidential candidates, Radu Campeanu, Ion Iliescu, and Ion Ratiu. After spending the last few months,\nprotesting and marching, the time came for Romanians to make a decision. On the 20th of May 1990, post-communist Romania\nwas going to hold its first free election. Ion Iliescu and the National Salvation Front\nwere competing with the historical parties resurrected after the Revolution: The National Liberal Party, led by Radu Campeanu, And the National Peasants' Party,\nbacking Ion Ratiu for president. Both returned to Romania at the beginning\nof 1990, after a long exile in the West and convinced that Romanians wouldn't elect a former\ncommunist leader as president. Mr. Iliescu acknowledges that the system he grew up in and which he served his entire life is\na disaster and in need of radical change. If we'd want to pursue a relationship with the East,\nI would vote for Mr. Iliescu But, if we wish to connect with the West,\nthen Mr. Iliescu doesn't have the credibility this country currently needs in\norder to become a democracy. If you'll excuse me, I feel I must\naddress some of your points. I believe we shouldn't look towards East or West,\nbut towards Romania first. A Romanian democracy must be built\nwith an understanding of the realities in Romania and not by copying foreign models. We've copied a foreign model before\nand it proved to be bankrupt. Therefore, we shouldn't look to\nforeign models for guidance... I want a free democracy! We, the workers, should be the\nowners of this nation's resources! 50% Romanians, 50% foreigners! How can we allow foreigners as owners? Not, not to own. What are you going on about, boy? You're young, you have no\nidea what life is about. I'm 52 years old, I know what it means for\nan employer to come in and boss you around. Let's not blindly copy from others! Servitude to the West isn't less dignified\nthan servitude to the East. We don't need any kind of servitude. Ion Iliescu's message would easily relate with the public, while the speeches on democracy and\nWestern values from Ratiu and Campeanu were met with an instinctive reluctance. They're not our people, man.\nThey didn't eat soy salami. These messages spread really fast:\nthey didn't eat soy salami like we did. They didn't suffer Please, listen up! Please, listen up! Give him a megaphone! Get a second megaphone! We can hear you, we can hear you! Ratiu: bowtie. No one wears a bowtie.\nHe's not one of us. You don't show up in front\nof a poverty-stricken nation, a nation which lived through\nthe most terrible events in its recent history, with a bowtie and an air of aristocracy\nwhich 90% of the population couldn't relate with. They kept me locked up for three hours at the\nBuzau Police Department, ready to lynch me! While trying to somehow explain that democracy\nmeans listening to an argument before disagreeing with it. The essence of democracy is this: I will fight until my dying breath for you\nto have the right to disagree with me. He was talking about very lofty ideals.\nBut these could not be used to lead Romania in 1990. Romania in 1990 was a country where\nmany were former members of the Communist Party, members of the secret police,\npeople unable to carry the burden of freedom. And then there was Ratiu and his ideals.\nIt wouldn't have worked. It wouldn't have worked because the\nmajority of Romanians rejected anything unrelated to their communist past. We don't agree with the ones\nthat came from abroad! They lived in capitalism and now\nthey come to our country? It doesn't matter whether\nit's communism or  capitalism. What matters is that we don't elect the ones\nwho came from abroad, they should go back abroad! But not all historical parties leaders\ncame from the West. Corneliu Coposu, president of\nthe Peasants' Party came with the moral authority of having spent\n17 years in communist prisons. But the country wasn't impressed. In early 1990, thousands of workers stormed\nthe Peasants' Party headquarters, ready to lynch Coposu. Ole, OIe. Get out, old man! I remember when I got the call\nfrom Corneliu Coposu and he said there's a risk of physical harm\nfor the leaders of the Peasants' Party. I went there right away. Leave the country! Leave the country! We don't have the right to mistreat them! I went to the balcony and tried\nto address the crowds and then we heard that slogan:\n'They didn't eat soy salami' and that's when I lost the plot, as they say. I said: Folks, the man you see\nnext to me, Corneliu Coposu, spent 17 years in communist prisons.\nWhat are you talking about? He'd be lucky to get some\nbread and some water. He could only dream about soy salami! Brothers, please understand, right now\nthe whole world is watching us. We won at the Revolution! I beg you,\nlet's win at democracy as well! Coposu escaped the anger of the crowd\nin an army's armored vehicle. People were convinced they\nmanaged to remove a threat. Iliescu for president, not brainless Coposu! In this context, the result of the election on\nMay 20th was a foregone conclusion. But the FSN nevertheless adopted a series of populist\nmeasures in efforts to secure their votes. What's the situation at the moment?\nHow are pensions being paid? Pensions are paid based on the\ndecisions of the FSN. At the agricultural cooperative in Botoroaga,\nthey are paying out the pensions. Who wants to say a few words? It's clear that it's higher\nthan it used to be. Before, one would get, depending on their job,\naround 120-130 lei, sometimes 200. And now it's 500 lei upwards. - Did you get it?\n-Yes. Let's see it! I have it here! Are those new or old banknotes? They're good, that's what they are... Yes, it's true. You'd be able to get\ngroceries, salaries went up. In essence, from an economics perspective,\nthis amounts to bribing the population. To give them the false impression\nthat they're living better. You've accused me of bribing the population,\nof providing them with some basic needs. But we should care about the living standards\nand about doing what's needed in these trying times. And about helping these\npeople out as soon as possible, This is a serious matter. Ratiu and Campeanu were right to accuse Iliescu\nand Roman of bribing the population before the elections. And they bribed it with serious money. They paid back, to the entire population,\nthe funds from the so-called 'social shares'. These were some sort of share options\noffered by your employer. Part of your salary would go towards buying these,\non the promise you'd get a share of the profit. Whenever the enterprise would become profitable. Well, over the years, that money\namounted to a nice payout. I think it was around 17 billion Lei\n(approx $120m in 1990) I was the last one to fight this\nand say: no, no, no! But the pressure to pay this out was\nunbearable. And none of it was right. They wanted to win the elections, right? So they paid all of it out. They would\ntell people: 'Just go to the cashier'. Cash in hand! I got some as well, it\nwas a nice payout. I remember a colleague, bearded, fat guy,\nwho got his money from the cashier and said: 'That's more like it!' That's more like it... That was the attitude at the time.\nAnd of course, people went to vote in droves. To vote Iliescu and Roman.\n'Cause at least they gave us something' And such was the day of May 20th 1990,\na day of patience and reflection, when the Romanians searched\nfor their path to the future, a pursuit emphasised by the high turnout\nat the first free elections since World War II. 15 million voters would elect the Senate,\nthe Chamber of Deputies, and the president of Romania. I voted for Iliescu.\nIn May 1990, I voted for Iliescu. Because I was thoroughly brainwashed\nby the FSN propaganda. I was a believer. I voted for Iliescu on a single argument:\nat that time, he was the only one able to deliver some stability. I never regretted this decision and, believe me,\nthere was no other option. THE MAN WE NEED I believe Iliescu was inevitable. I think it was an awful solution for Romania,\nbut it was an inevitable one. Mr. Ion Iliescu, who secured over 12\nmillion votes, becoming the president elect, has outlined the issues facing the President,\nthe Parliament, and the new Government. What did we do wrong then? We didn't do anything wrong. This was the natural course\nof our history. People who were in the system before\nthe 90's had a lot of experience in running an organisation. The party machinery, the secret police, they had\nwell defined structures. While the people, the civil society in Romania,\nwas nonexistent at the time. I pledge allegiance to the Romanian people,\nits ideals of liberty and prosperity. I pledge to uphold the laws of the country,\nto safeguard democracy. On June 13th 1990, weeks after Ion Iliescu became\nthe first president of post-communist Romania, law enforcement brutally squashed the rest\nof the protests in University Square. Out with Iliescu! Shame! They're killing people in the street! Shame! Incidents escalated, and Bucharest\nstarted to look like a war zone. The violence on that day, when institutions\nwere attacked with Molotov cocktails, were never cleared up. June 13th was a horrendous event. That was an attempt - I still believe to this day -\nof the former secrete police to reinstate itself in Romanian society. The idea was very simple: \"we\nstill need to be a lever of power\". Whether they were masterminded\nby the secret police or not, the events on June 13th determined\nIliescu to call the entire population to take the streets. We are dealing with a rebellion\nof a fascist nature. Therefore, we need a unity between\nall the conscious powers in the country, of the whole nation, to respond to these... The next morning, June 14th, tens of thousands of miners arrived in\nthe Capital, responding to Ion Iliescu's call, but also because of the newly founded SRI\n(Romanian Intelligence Service) It's been proven, as I've noted in\nthe SRI's report at the time, that, disappointingly, there were some\nintelligence officers, part of the SRI, who were involved in bringing the miners in.\nAnd causing a thing that should never have happened. Bringing in the miners was, in\nfact, their (the SRI officers') most important action. Because they planned it,\nwe ended up with the miners here, which then led to the horrible\nevents we've seen at the time. Very early in the morning of June 14th, we got the news that the\nminers were near Bucharest. We decided that Ion Iliescu would address\nthem, as he was their man, so to speak. And tell them \"I know you came all this way,\nbut there are no issues here.\" We'd give them a hot meal and\nthey'd be on their way. Unfortunately, things got out of\nhand, as you know. Instead of sending them home, Ion Iliescu\nsent the miners to University Square. The miners, lead by Mr. Cozma, will\nadvance towards University Square, which we wish for you to occupy. This is where scenes of unprecedented\nviolence took place, images that would be seen worldwide and would label Romania as a\nnation declining into anarchy. Some people with some clubs bludgeoned some other people,\nlaw enforcement was in riot gear buses and the Home Office were set on fire.\nThis wasn't what shocked the Western viewer though. They've seen their fair share of this. The novelty was that all of this was\nsomehow a response to a call from the authorities. One part of the population\nwas pitted against the other. Romania was closely followed at the\ntime, it was all around the news. There were lots of freelance journalists\nin the country at the time Naturally, Romania's image deteriorated. I was in Paris, right after these events,\nand I could've argued anything I'm blue-eyed, I'm Romanian, I read Baudelaire.\nThe response was always: 'Les Mineurs' (The Miners) Chapter 3\nThe school of piranhas What's your name? Cotarla Marian. What's that? Cotarla Marian. And do you go to school? Yes. Where? 108. School number 108, right? What grade? Tenth grade. Where did you get these cigarettes? I bought them. Where from? Foreigners. You mean foreign citizens, right? How much did you pay? 30. 30? And here you sell them\nfor 50-60 lei, right? No, 40. 40, right? So that you can make a profit. Right? After half a year of violence and uncertainty, Romanians were discovering\nthe upsides of democracy. And the most daring of them started testing the most basic\nforms of capitalism in the street. Dear viewers, we're looking at\nso-called trading (bisnita, meaning scalping) a word that, someone told me jokingly, might come from the English word \"business\". I also went out on the boulevard,\nI'm not ashamed to admit it. I sold cigarettes, tickets, jeans. I did a bit of trading, so to speak. At that time it was called a scalping (bișniță) How much did you pay for these? I bought them for 70 lei, so same price. I got stuck with them and... And you sell them for 75? He asked me for 75. You know what? Yeah, I know, you asked me 75. Where do you work? Come on, this is a waste of time! It was inevitable! This was\nthe emergence of capitalism. Things were being sold\neverywhere. Anything worked. No matter what you were selling,\npeople would buy it. The problem was getting the goods. The more stock you had and the more\ndiversified, the more you'd sell. I was making a bag of money. Yes, I had a lot of money. A lot of money even by today's\nstandards, never mind back then. Because things were going well, to be honest. Smuggling. In 1990, more than\nhalf of business people would go to places like Turkey and\ncome back with truckloads of goods. They would buy cigarettes for 12\nlei and they would then sell them for 100. They would buy jeans for $10\nand then sell it for $100-200 in Romania. That was the business back then. You would see on our roads Dacia\ncars with the trunks full to the brim. With goods from Turkey. I was the Minister of Finance\nand Petre Roman was prime minister. I accompanied him on a visit to Turkey. Where, at that time,\nthe president was an economist And in a discussion with him, he said: \"I've noticed a great deal of traffic from Romania to Turkey, from Turkey to Romania.\" \"Some bring ball bearings to sell in Turkey.\nFrom Turkey they buy gold, silk.\" And I thought, \"What do I do now?\" \"Should I strengthen border checks,\nenforce custom duty?\" And we said:\n\"Let them trade!\" Who could resist that huge wave\nthat started in Romania in the 90's? Absolutely no one! You can't get in the way of a people, my friend,\nno matter who you were. They brought that gold jewellery from\nTurkey, they called it \"peas\". Those chains and bracelets. And I would sell them in the\nshop for a 50% margin. And, after about a year,\nI got a visit from Revenue and Customs. I got fined because I didn't have a license to sell it.\nI didn't know that I wasn't allowed to sell gold. Apparently I needed a license from BNR\n(National Bank of Romania). I'm not gonna lie,\nI kept selling for a few more years without any license, just as before. I was selling one kilogram of\ngold every three days. After the Revolution, in 1990,\nthe beginning of 1990, we were like a school of piranhas. We would jump at anything that moves. No laws, no taxes, no duty, nothing. You should know that this scalping\nhad a positive impact too. Because it kept money\nmoving in the economy. I did the smartest thing\nthat anyone could do. I wasn't happy with opening just\none shop, so I opened 174. Simple! I wasn't happy with smuggling a Dacia trunk,\nI smuggled 15-20 trucks a day. Simple! He was the first to open a shop in Bacău.\nHe was from Roman by birth. He hired a venue in the centre\nof Bacau, and opened a shop, Royal Boutique. I remember what it was called. \"Royal Boutique, the arbiter\nof elegance in Bacău\" was the tagline. When they were restocking,\npeople could kill for it: clothes, knitwear, slippers, purses,\nwatches, gold, cigarettes, anything. It was a bazaar, basically,\nthis Royal Boutique. There was nothing \"royal\" about it. I had only one thing in mind at the time:\nto make money. Nothing else! The merchants bringing goods from Turkey\nweren't the only ones to make money in the early 1990s. In communist Romania there was a small group\nof people who knew the rules of capitalism, and after the Revolution they exploited\nRomanians' naivety and consumerism. One of these people was George Pădure, who\nopened the first appliance store in Romania, Gepa. We had 40,000 items. I made a boom here. Crazy. VHS's and TVs sold really well. TVs, refrigerators, cars ... Everything that the Romanians\nlacked during communism. And the boom started. Those were happy times. There were times when, obviously,\na lot of money was being made. Remember, there were\nmargins of up to 6000%. Just so you know what we're talking about. Well, think about it now you buy that vase for 100 euros\nand sell it for 6000 euros. You didn't pay corporate tax,\nyou didn't pay anything. That's a profit of 5900 euros in your pocket. Like George Pădure, in communism Viorel Catarama\nworked for a private company in the West. This was almost impossible without\nhaving some connection with the Security. I started living well since 1988 when I became the employee and manager\nin Eastern Europe for Belco. We bought furniture from Eastern\nEurope to sell it in the Benelux. Mr. Viorel Catarama is among the few who, prior to '89, worked in foreign trade. They were the only people who had\nthe list of foreign clients. He used his contacts.\nSo did most people in these kinds of jobs. Right after the Revolution, when\nthe law was passed to allow private companies, quite a few of the people involved\nin foreign trade registered private companies, and took over the network of external customers who were now trading through these new companies. Viorel Catarama was one\nof those who used this method. Immediately after the Revolution, he left\nBelco and founded his own company, Elvila. After 1990, the company Belco\nbecame the client of Elvila. And instead of buying furniture\nfrom Tehno Forest, it would buy furniture from Elvila. The company owned by a former foreign trade officer\nbecame the middleman between state-owned companies and foreign companies importing from Romania. On one side, they were dealing\nwith the international contract. At the same time, they were handling the domestic contract\nand had full bargaining power with the domestic supplier. Which had no leverage whatsoever! Many who worked in foreign\ntrade were Security officers, and they would pull the strings\nof export-import relationships. Yes, they were profiteers. It's true. There are many former Security officers who have become businessmen and who operated, in ways which indeed were\nthreatening to the Romanian state. I never denied and I'll never deny that I've been labelled in certain ways\nfor the past 25 years. Like being a Security officer. I don't deny it! I would only be denying what\nis a matter of record. Iliescu made a pact\nthen with the Security. He brought them back in and opened\nthe gates of business for them. I don't remember ever having\ncontact with a Security officer. I might have, but without my knowledge. And I found out later that my boss,\nDragoș Diaconescu, had ties to the Security. Colleagues, employees of the Chamber of Commerce,\nof the Argus Office. Look, I was in those 20, or 10 people,\nthe 2%, or 0.2% that were not (part of Security). From businessmen to foreign trade officers, the first capitalists of the post-communists\nRomania exploited the circumstances and profitted hugely. It was the beginnings of certain types of wealth\nwhich now allows some individuals to look down on us. 30 years later. Themselves,\ntheir family, their descendants. It was then, in 1990. I made a lot of money! It's just a fact. Money in the bag. Some in\ncarrier bags, some in briefcases. There were many anomalies. But this was life, it was beautiful. It was a start. So money, profit making,\nco-financial economic indicators the business plan, the revenue\nand expenditure budget were secondary. We were young! Life was beautiful! At the end of 1990, I had a 4 room flat. Somewhere in Roman. I managed to furnish three\nrooms before the Revolution, the fourth room, the living room,\nwasn't furnished. At the end of 1990, I had in the unfurnished room\n$100 million in cash. I celebrated with my wife back then by drinking a bottle of champagne and making love on $100 million cash. Despite the increasing number of\nRomanians venturing into business, most of the population was still\nemployed in factories and plants. But the desire to feel the benefits\nof democracy were just as great. There was a lot of pressure to have\nan extra non-working day a week (Saturday), like the West. People worked less, produced less,\nand still wanted higher wages. That's when I said:\n\"We can't make a living if we don't work!\" Petre Roman, yes, is right. After the Revolution,\nthe workers said: \"We are finally in charge now\" \"The dictatorship is over!\" \"And this is our factory, mister!\" \"We do what we want with it!\" So we had months when the economy, the businesses\nwere fending for themselves. I went to Tractor factory in Brasov. And people had some demands. And they were expecting me to give them some words of encouragement. And then I said, \"Fellows!\" \"Do you wanna know how we're doing?\" \"Look, I'll tell you how we're doing.\" I'll tell you exactly what I did. \"This is how we're doing.\" And then I did this. \"That's how we're doing.\" \"Empty pockets.\" At the end of 1990, the gross\ndomestic product collapsed by more than 10% The left overs from the communist\nregime were dwindling every month, and transitional measures to\na market economy were inevitable. We needed to transform\nthe super-centralized economy into a free economy,\ninto a private economy. Basically, in Romania you had to start building. And to build, Romania needed foreign\ninvestments to modernize communist factories. Roman truck factory from Brașov was the first with a chance\nto get out of the deadlock of this period. The opportunity for the truck factory in Brașov was for a big player in the industry,\nlike Mercedes, or Volvo, to come in and do what Renault did for Dacia. In april 1990, Werner Niefer,\nthe General Director of Mercedes, came to me and said: \"Mr. Prime Minister,\" \"Look, Mercedes doesn't make\nbuses or trucks outside Germany.\" \"I'm ready to come and make them in Romania.\" And what did we do with it? \"Our country's not for sale!\" \"Our country's not for sale!\" \"Don't let others come and privatize\nthings, we know better! \" Nationalism and the revival of these\npatriotic feelings had a direct effect. This is how some thinking patterns were created which later would be difficult to dislodge. \"Our country's not for sale!\" This slogan still works today. It was that wretched chant\nthat destroyed these companies. They don't exist anymore! Our country's not for sale! But the chant wasn't coming\nfrom the workers protesting in the streets but from a group of experienced communist ideologues. Most notably, Alexandru Bârlădeanu,\nwho was part of the Government since the 1950s. In 1990, he became head of the\nSenate and advisor to President Iliescu. Politically, this was a group of Marxists. That is, they didn't trust the market\neconomy. As simple as that. It's easy to throw out phrases like 'immediate privatization'. But we need to understand its social cost. Unfortunately, Iliescu was heavily\ninfluenced by this group. And then he had his own\ndoubts, because he was himself a product of that era and regime, of that system. The issue of privatization\nand openness to foreign investors caused an irreparable rupture between\nPresident Iliescu and Prime Minister Roman. Before the second half of 1991, it became clear that two main characters of the Revolution\ncouldn't lead the country together. In August 1991, I passed the Privatization Law. Bârlădeanu was the president\nof the Senate and from the FSN. The Roman Government was a FSN Government. The evening I passed this law, Bârlădeanu went and destroyed it on TV. Because this law already had\nprovisions for privatization. One month after I passed the\nPrivatization Law, the miners came. On September 25, 1991, over 10,000 miners from the Jiu Valley\ntook over several trains and went to Bucharest to ask for\nhigher wages and better working conditions. And will be granted a fixed\namount, not subject to taxation! I was next to Miron Cozma, when he\ngave the order to attack the Government building. The law enforcement tasked with\ndefending the building stepped aside and the miners plundered Victoria Palace. In Parliament, the resignation of\nPrime Minister Petre Roman is being announced. In a conversation\nwith Mr. Iliescu, He confirmed that Mr. Petre\nRoman requested to withdraw. \"The Prime Minister has resigned!\"\nWhich at that time was a blatant lie! A despicable political maneuver,\nmeant to prevent the reform. Which it did. It really did. But the miners were not aware\nof the political maneuvers. Having absolute power, Miron Cozma's people decided\nthat overthrowing the Government wasn't enough. Out with Iliescu! After they managed to overthrow the Government a large group of miners, probably uncontrolled, joined with disgruntled citizens\nand marched to besiege Cotroceni Palace. To get rid of Iliescu while they're\nat it, not just of Roman. And there, unlike the Romanian Government, which at that time didn't even have a fence, Cotroceni Palace had a tall wall. And then three characters appeared. Two with rifles and one who would hand them bullet rounds. They were shooting pellet shots. They fired straight into the crowd. A few minor injuries were reported.\nIt was hard to kill anyone from that distance. And in 15 minutes the\nsquare was evacuated. They all ran off. After the danger was removed, Ion Iliescu sat down with the\nminer's representatives. ...In order to end this conflict\nand this degeneration of the protest. Miron Cozma discussed with the\nPresident of Romania from a position of power. We request for you to acknowledge\nthe current issues, which we'll discuss shortly. Under the following conditions,\nwe are willing to return home: The resignation of Prime Minister\nPetre Roman and the entire Government. When Miron Cozma arrived, he signed a pact, a kind of\ndocument with Ion Iliescu. Ion Iliescu, the elected president of Romania, and Miron Cozma, the head of\nthe bandits, in lack of a better term. I'm sorry you have to bear the brunt of the\nactions of an arrogant and self-centered man. From that moment on, all the openness we had\nwith the West was blocked. Helmut Kohl's first statement was: \"At the moment, all relations\nwith Romania are frozen\" Ciao! We'll be back! We'll be back again! Chapter 4:\nThe Stagnation After the Mineriad of 1991, the country is ruled by a coalition\ngovernment led by Theodor Stolojan There is a way out of the transition period and this stage could take anywhere between ten, fifteen, maybe even twenty years. FSN, the party elected after\nthe revolution, splits in two. The progressive wing, led by\nPetre Roman, keeps the \"FSN\" name, while the conservative wing,\ngathered around Ion Iliescu, founds a new party FDSN\n(the Democratic National Salvation Front) (chanting) Long live Iliescu, make Romania flourish! In the autumn of 1992 new\nelections are scheduled and Ion Iliescu starts as the\nfavourite against Emil Constantinescu. On the first of October, between\nthe two voting rounds, Michael Jackson arrives in Bucharest. Romanians show a preference for Western\nmusic, but not so much for Western politics. On the eleventh of October 1992, Ion Iliescu\nis elected president for the second time. The worst thing to happen\nto Romania during those years was Ion Iliescu's win in the 1992 elections. That was it. If Emil Constantinescu would have won\nin 1992, with the Democratic Convention, Romania would've moved forward four years . These were the years when we\nmissed all our opportunities. Nicolae Vacaroiu was the prime\nminister of Romania during those years, an average economist who worked in the\nState Committee of Communist Planning for twenty years. Of course, my naming as prime minister\ntook me by surprise. I didn't know Iliescu personally until then. He probably said, \"Things are so bad that we need a man who knows the economy well who can save us and\nget us through the winter.\" His government went through the parliament\nwith the support of the so-called \"red four\", a political bloc consisting of parties such as\nGheorghe Funar's PUNR, Vadim Tudor's PRM and Ilie Verdeț's PSM,\nformer prime minister during Ceausescu. They all had their origins\nin the Communist Party. That was it! The return to a way of running the economy centrally. Running a centralised economy meant retaining an industry\nthat was in an advanced state of decay. However, no one wanted to accept this reality. What do you mean, close a factory? It was unheard of! \"We need to build, to improve our products\". You couldn't make any\nkind of improvements. Why? One thing that was true\nand which frightened Roman: the Romanian industry was a scrapheap. Yes, it was.\nOutdated. You know, we've inherited a fountain with no water as well as the lie that\nthere's water in the fountain. Because Ceausescu had\nstopped all technology imports. Romania was one of the world's\ntop manufacturers of oil equipment. Where did we lose touch with the industry? Right when electronics and\nthe oil equipment industries merged. We kept using ... ...manual labour, while the West embraced this symbiosis\nand we, at that point, began to lag behind. Come! Be careful! Our working conditions ... ... I wouldn't be exaggerating if\nI'd compare them to 1900. Maybe worse. Because if we take a closer look... ...Looking at the past few years... So, thirty years ago, the machines were the same as they were... 30 years ago, but now they're 30 years old. I don't know if I was clear enough. I was working at FEA,\nthe Factory for Elements of Automation. It was on the Pipera platform. That was a factory built by\nthe Japanese in the 1970s. Very modern at the time. I was working in a department\ncalled \"Power supplies\" We were making voltage-stabilising power\nsupplies for the computers of that time. When the Japanese were running it, the workshop\nwas making 25 power supplies a month 25 of which worked. After the Japanese left and towards\nthe late '80s, when I was there in '89, the workshop would make 100 sources\na month, out of which 2 or 3 were working. This phenomenon describes the entire socialist\neconomy: production for the sake of production. Production of equipment, tools, anything.\nWhich, at best, were not in demand. And more commonly, they didn't even work. There were many products in Romania, where the cost to make them was\nhigher than their market value. They were made, for example, to be exported.\nBut you wouldn't export them to France or Germany. You would export them in the Comecon system\n(The Mutual Economic Aid Council). We would supply ball-bearings to Poland,\nand they'd supply us with lighters, for example. Even if we didn't need them. And that was Comecon. These things didn't work anymore\nafter the socialist system collapsed. Comecon didn't exist anymore, the\nRussians weren't buying anymore. The other countries were becoming democracies. Clearly, such a system couldn't last forever. As long as it was designed\nnot to make goods, but to make jobs. That was the band-aid\nthat socialism put on these countries. The illusion of having a job\nand no problems whatsoever. For 4 years, the biggest concern for\nIon Iliescu and the Văcăroiu government was to keep this band-aid,\nwhich sustained a great illusion: job security. Of course, the fundamental idea was: \"Don't upset the workers!\" That's how Iliescu saw it at the time, but as long as no one would buy those goods, the money came from the state budget\nor God knows where from. The money wasn't\ncoming in the natural way: you sell some goods and\nget some money. Of course, companies making\na loss were being subsidized. But not just one, many!\nEven the larger ones. Workers were going to work for nothing.\nThat's the main point. People had this feeling: \"We go in, we work\nand we make things.\" They were making to stock. Finished products were made,\nbut nobody would buy them. That's not how it worked.. While I was prime minister,\nI didn't make anything to stock. When you start a process like this, you don't just close the factories overnight. Imagine I shut down the factories\nand fire 2 million people. How do you feed people\nif they're not productive? During those years, the Văcăroiu Government\nstimulated a supply which couldn't turn a profit. Often of questionable quality, the Romanian goods\nhad another handicap. Even when it was competitive, it was\nwarehoused, because there was no one to sell it. There was now another myth,\nanother mental barrier to overcome: supply vs sale. We had good engineers. And that was it. They were good at making things. We didn't have people in marketing,\nin investments, we had no economists for sector analysis. We didn't have anything like that. Can you imagine the mental shift to accept the idea that sales\nare more important than production? Because, in fact, that's\nthe revolutionary capitalist idea: I, the buyer, come to you, the manufacturer. You don't manufacture whatever you want! You manufacture what I ask you to! I come in and say: \"Stop making those sandals\nbecause they don't sell! You're going to make red flip-flops,\nthese are going to sell! \" Something like that, in 1990, to accept the idea that\nsellers are more important than those who work hard, who make things,\nthe ones who bend the matter? For this kind of idea, you could get beaten up. The leaders at the time didn't want\nto overcome these mental barriers. They left them there in order\nto help them stay in power. Let's not forget the difficult\nsocial situation we're in. Making this transition abruptly, sacrificing people's living conditions, using sacrificial curves, so to speak,\nfor a large part of people, it's something we need to consider\ncarefully and responsibily. The attempt of Iliescu and his regime,\nthe Văcăroiu government and its famous stagnation,\nto keep these dinosaurs operating costed the Romanian people greatly. There was absolutely no stagnation. Everything was done by the book. Things are going, we'd say, well. The government does nothing\nbut deliver on the plan that was agreed upon. And, of course, the rest ... The rest of Romania remained sad and gray,\nled without a strategy and avoided by foreign investors. Remember, for years,\nforeign investors were cautions about us. I mean, Romania was always a red flag. What's the red flag doing? \"Well, the miners come in from time\nto time and they beat you up.\" There is still a lot of reluctance\nfrom foreign investors, for a variety of reasons. Please allow me to\navoid elaborating on these reasons. I think you know them well\nand debated these at length. Why would they come here?\nTo negotiate with whom? With Nicu Văcăroiu and Florin Georgescu? They were sitting like this on\nthe Romanian factory: \"Let's defend our Romanian\nassets with all our might!\" Everyone from abroad were sending us all kinds of experts. And they even taught us what laws to create. Do you get me? They didn't necessarily do it to raise Romania to the top. Let's be serious! Their plan was to transform\nRomania into a retail market. Race horses, jockey, racecourse.\nImages familiar to the people of Ialomita. While foreign investors\nkept away from the Romanian capital, the scalpers of the transition graduated\nto the next level, posing as big businessmen. They exist because of the\nwell-known company Hermes in Slobozia. Which, through its owner, Mr. Ilie Alexandru,\napproached with understanding, with passion this prince of the planes: the horse. Ilie Alexandru bet on the people's fascination with the West, with everything they\nmissed out on during those years. In these images is brought together Hermes' desire to do something\ndifferent, something unheard of. These were all thieves. Everything Ilie Alexander built\nwas with the money he took from Bancorex which he had no plans to ever pay back. He borrowed some millions of dollars. and didn't pay a single penny back. That's how the largest Romanian bank\nat the time was robbed. Bancorex was the former\nRomanian Foreign Trade Bank, through which the communist state\nwas running its international operations. In the 1990s, it reported losses\nof over two billion dollars, due to loans taken\nby people connected with the state. When they were asked: \"Well, mister, you have to pay this\nmoney back or you'll be arrested\" What would they reply?\n\"I create jobs!\" Everyone was saying: \"I create jobs\" I only find one thing important here:\nwhat I did in this country, the thousands of jobs we created are not there to benefit me. The problem, after all, is not that\nyou earned a lot of money fast The problem is whether you can also\nkeep the business alive after you got rich. Or develop it. Because, in the end, for the Romanian state it's important for the business to work, to pay salaries and taxes. The Iliescu regime encouraged\nthe rise of these so-called cardboard millionaires. It allowed them to bankrupt banks, it\nenabled fraudulent privatizations and supplied them with favourable laws. Back then, they made targeted laws. Government orders for\n2-3 months, for one or ten people. That's how we got the 72% tax for TVs. I would pay them, but that\nmeant my price was doubling. Copos was selling for half the price. What was I going to do?\nI couldn't fight him The law said that: \"...TVs supplied with an\ninfrared remote control system\". Copos would take out the\nremote and sell it separately. He'd tell you: \"For the remote you\nhave to go next door.\" He got a lot of help. It's true that through the laws that were passed We fought only\nfor the development of local capital. So that we don't become the colony we are today! I remember very well that\nthere were a couple of Government orders which lifted\ncustoms duties for 24 hours. Simply: \"ball-bearings are exempt\nfrom custom duty between 27 and 28 August.\" The Government order would be published, the bearings would be loaded\nfrom the ships into trucks. And that's it! No customs duty. Then the duty was reinstated after 24 hours. Just long enough for that friend of the\nprime minister to solve a problem. People wouldn't even\nhear about these things. These things were done and that's it. They'd take - or split- the money,\nand the people knew nothing I knew the only way to develop my\ncompany was through investment. I decided to invest in transport. I bought 5 trucks from\nthe Brasov Truck Factory. And because fortune favours the bold, the day after I bought\nthem, their price has tripled. It became a problem when these people wanted to gain political influence. And to combine the two aspects. And this was the route of Dumitru Sechelariu,\nwho in '96 became mayor. From the position of mayor, he began to serve,\nwithout any shame, his own financial interests. Dumitru Sechelariu, a businessman turned\nPDSR (former FDSN) party member and mayor, wasn't an exception, but a norm that would\ndefine Romanian politics in the coming decades. The ones who got rich during the transition\nwere present in all parties. In the 90s, I went to Radu Campeanu\nand told him that I, citizen Viorel Catarama like the ideas he brings into public debate and I want to support the\nNational Liberal Party financially. Without me getting involved in politics.\nI'd only provide some support. Viorel Catarama supported the party financially, and\nlater became its vice president and part of the Government No law prevented me then to be a minister,\ngeneral manager, and shareholder. In parallel The direct link between politics\nand business was becoming a norm. I became a PDSR member despite seeing my self a small businessman,\nwho only wants to be a bigger businessman. I didn't see any issue\nwith running these things in parallel The attitude was different then. I was only interested in how much I earn. And I don't think anyone was losing.\nWho was losing? In the new oligarchic Romania\nmade up of politicians and businessmen, the ones losing were millions of Romanians,\ncaptive in the bankrupt industry of the 1990s. The illusion that was sold to the\npeople was wearing out. Everything was a sign of collapse. Abandoned children, hyperinflation,\nendless strikes. Thieves! Thieves! It hurts us that in His light The earth holds a bad world In the mines, God is with us ... For more and more Romanians,\nsurvival became the main concern. My pension is the equivalent of four\nkilograms of salami. That's it. That's it I don't even know if it's enough for that. ... yes, I have just enough. But then I still have to pay for gas,\nelectricity and maintenance. Some people were shuddering, frightened... Nobody cursed at me during that time\nand I went to all the protests. Huo! Huo! Thieves! Thieves! I remember, there were strike\nafter strike after strike. And an inflation of 290%\nor something. It was incredible! We are starving! Thieves! Thieves! These were very difficult times for Romanians. It was terrible, yes, terrible. And with many collateral\ndamages among regular people. With what you'd pay for a car in 1990, in 1995 you'd only buy a motorcycle, for example. And many lost their savings by not knowing\nabout inflation, or mechanics of economy. They lost their life savings exactly like this. Besides inflation, the Romanians' savings\nwere exposed to other dangers of the transition. Pyramid schemes, like the famous Caritas, harmed hundreds of thousands who believed\nthe magic formula of getting rich quick. Deposit one million, wait a few\nweeks, get back eight million. At my age of 86, going on 87,\nI didn't have that much money. How much did you deposit here? Well how much ... about two million This combination of naivety, despair\nand poverty which reigned in Romania in those years reached its peak in the villages\nthroughout the country. The abolition of the Cooperatives\nput peasants in a difficult situation. They got their lands back,\nbut having no machinery to work with, they went backwards by 100 years. What do you work the land with?\nDo you have any tools? We don't have any! With the hoe, look! We have no tractor, no horse,\nwe have nothing. This is how we struggle\nwith the hoe all summer, dear. When did you sell the land? I sold a piece of land. How much did you get for it? About two and a half million. Money has devalued,\nwhat will you do next? We keep seling. I got the property title,\nwe keep selling, there's no other option. After working their whole lives\nin the communist collective farms, The peasants woke\nup to some pitiable pensions. I'm even embarassed to hand the pension to many people. I feel sorry for them... I take the pensions to some pensioners\nwho get something like 40,000 - 50,000 lei But when I go to the one with 4,000,\nI feel bad to even count that. Because I'm used to counting\n30-40,000 upwards, like with the others. It pains me to give them 4,000 lei\n(approx 2 dollars in 1994) The Romanian state seemed to\nhave abandoned these people. Only some random MP would write\nthem the occasional poem. Request. We'd like, if possible To ask of our new masters To maybe pay us in instalments the two-cent pension The pension of the Romanian peasants. You stole our land, You tied our ankles and our hands Cooperatives are all impoverished All I've ever given is gone forever. The lives of Romanian peasants We have no bread, firewood and dishes We're hungry and naked like dogs Chapter 5\nTowards Europe Mister president, distinguished representatives. The spectactulare evolutions in\nthe area of Eastern Europe. And the firm determination of Romania to\nhave a market-oriented economy. Needs the support of industrialised countries. After 5 years of the economy collapsing,\nand with people barely making ends meet, the leaders of post-revolution Romania are\nforced to accept the failures of the original democracy. Those who urged Romanians\nnot to sell their country were now telling them\nthat the only solution is looking to the West. \"Guys, we have Carpathians, Danube.\nWe, the Romanians, can make it on our own\" Look, it doesn't work! We have to work with Europe and others. Are we heading towards the EU?\nLet's make a statement then. On June 21, 1995, representatives from all political parties,\nthe unions, the Academy and the Church took part in the signing of\nthe Snagov declaration, a document that united everyone towards\na goal for the next decade: Romania to join the EU. Shall we start? Let me now, yeah? I think today is an important political moment. It's about expressing the unequivocal will\nof the parliamentary parties to accept as a major objective ... ..the integration into European structures. A good, necessary step was taken. The Great Romania Party always assumed that Romania was in Europe\neven before the birth of Europe. Do you think they just caught the EU fever? Do you think they had Western values in mind? Do you think they wanted economic\nregulation like the West? No! At that moment, our great friend,\nThe Soviet Union had broken up So we didn't have much to guide us\nand going it alone was impossible. Basically, those in power\nlooked at the global situation and said: \"Ok, we have to take this route,\notherwise we'll have Ceausescu's fate.\" That is: no food, serious economic\nissues and everything collapses again. The Snagov meeting symbolized the\ndeparture from the original democracy, which was masking a combination\nof democracy and dictatorship. The suffering has passed, what matters is that the\nfuture provides something good for the country. The rest is no longer important. Also in 1995, a few months\nafter the Snagov Declaration, another event proved that Romanians\nbegan to understand their past mistakes. An inexplicable phenomenon occurred. Sometimes, things like these happen.. The huge lines behind Corneliu Coposu's funeral. A sort of a revelation. It's like they went there to tell him:\n\"Forgive us!\" That was the feeling: \"Forgive us!\" Part of the Romanian democracy died. It's a shame, it's a great shame.\nFor us, but particularly for you. He showed the kind of character that few\nwould be able to after 50 years of struggles and unhappiness. Corneliu Coposu, the man who thousands of people\ntried to lynch in Bucharest in 1990, became post-mortem, the symbol\nof morality in Romanian politics. Through the disappointment\nthat overwhelmed Romania during those years, people were looking for hope to carry them forward. The political opposition, civil society\nand a growing share of the population began to believe in a word which for\na long time seemed unacceptable: Change. We need to put our finger on the wound.\nand find out where mistakes were made. But also, who made mistakes. The man who attracted all this\nenergy was Emil Constantinescu, a university professor who was going to\nto run for election in 1996 against Ion Iliescu. In '96 the change came from the alliance of the parties\nwhich represented an ideal. I support and we support Mr. Emil Constantinescu. I don't think Iliescu imagined\nthat it would come to this, but the moment I signed an\nagreement with Emil Constantinescu and campaigned for Emil Constantinescu, he understood that there was no way back. Iliescu for president! Somehow, Ion Iliescu didn't want to win\nthose elections that badly. As if he wasn't up for it anymore. Out with Iliescu! I understand the concerns, the dissatisfaction,\ndisappointment of many people regarding the difficult situation\nthat the national economy is going through. But we have to understand the\ncontext of this situation. In 1989 a system that could\nnot hold anymore collapsed, both in Romania and throughout\nthis area of Europe. This idea was popular in PSD: \"We can't close factories!\nBecause we can't\" \"We're the Communist Party, the working\nclass party, we can't close factories.\" \"Let's leave these guys in\ncharge for a few years\" \"They'll compromise themselves,\npeople will curse them, right?\" \"Let them close the factories.\" The change was also encouraged by the\nhead of the Romanian Intelligence Service. A pillar of the Iliescu regime, Virgil\nMăgureanu announced he'd vote for change. I was able to know if this should\nhappen or not. Change, that is. I was able and I did it. The change occurred in November 1996. It was a time when more\nand more Romanians were aware that the country\nneeds new leadership. I will vote for Emil Constantinescu. I vote for Emil Constantinescu. I voted and will continue to\nvote for Mr. Emil Constantinescu, because I trust him. After the ballot box was opened, Ion Iliescu had to acknowledge his defeat. To fulfill their commitments and promises ... Victory! Victory! When the results were announced,\npeople went out in the streets. Hey, Iliescu is gone! God was brought to life for us!\nGod in the skies! This was a turning point, because it was\nthe first time in the history of Romania when a head of state was\nchanged through a vote. Out with communism! Out with Iliescu! I was told that the people were\ngathering in the University Square, Spontaneously, no one called them there. I walked around it, to not succumb\nto the enthusiasm of the crowd, I went on the balcony,\nI didn't have a speech ready. We're all here again to say that Romania will\nbecome a dignified, prosperous country The free country that we all wanted! That together we will prove that\nwe're able to rebuild this country And all this time, I felt a chill. I realised that these people\nhad immeasurable hope. Soon it was winter and the hopes of\nRomanians were hit by reality. The price of gas increased four times,\nand that of petrol doubled. I'm holding it in my hand, what can I do? And while people were panicking, the new prime minister promised\nthem everything would be fine. Moving to another internal state of affairs, the population's welfare, Romania aligning with the global financial system... The Democratic Convention won the election\nwith the promise to bring into the public institutions 15,000 specialists able to reform\nthe state from the ground up. But, when forming a government, it was difficult to identify a single\nspecialist able to be prime minister. That's how Victor Ciorbea came to\nlead of the Government, a former union leader, recently\nelected as mayor of Bucharest. The CDR (Romanian Democratic Convention),\ndidn't have any truly prepared people. They were unable to name a prime minister!\nThey had to get Ciorbea, who wasn't the best fit for this job anyway. So that's true. People really had hope at that time. And believed the\npromises from those parties: \"15,000 specialists.\nWe have 15,000 specialists ready to go!\" Some people in the media started\nto make jokes for weeks on end that these specialists are Ciorbea,\nCiorbea, Ciorbea and so on. The idea of the 15,000 specialists came spontaneously and it was real. In all the counties in Romania, people representing historical\nparties were at the forefront There was a change everywhere in the country. I remember the leader of\nthe Peasants' Party in Bacau Mr. Cornita, who had been a political prisoner. A nice old man, with common sense,\nbut clearly unremarkable. How can I put this? I think it was one big\nparty in all the institutions and ministries. They were laughing their heads off,\nsaying \"This poor guy, let's set him up!\" I'll never forget, Ion Diaconescu, a star in\nthe Peasant's Party, said something really stupid It shocked me how much\nthese people lived in the past. He said: \"We want to rename the Government to 'Council of Ministers'.\nThat's what it was called back in my time\" Meaning the 1930s. And he was told \"You can't do that because in\nthe Constitution it's called the Government.\" Was this a priority? But the biggest challenges for the CDR\ngovernment were when they had to adopt unpopular measures,\npostponed by the Iliescu regime. That meant mainly closing the\nbankrupt state-owned enterprises. It was well known that the economic\nand financial situation was very serious and we knew we had to take\nsome dramatic measures! Structural reforms concerning engergy-intensive\ncompanies, who had huge losses. The independent administrations... None of this was done yet! When the Ciorbea Government tried\nto close the first 15 companies, the workers went to the street and said:\n\"No way!\" Out with the Government! It's a reality that, almost daily, we\nhad protests, rallies, marches, strikes. Victor Ciorbea resigned today, after, for the past few months, he was\nchallenged by his coalition partners. I didn't delay the reform, or the privatization,\nbut I had to start with the basics. The one who set this change in motion\nwas the Minister of Transport, Traian Basescu. In an interview for a national newspaper,\nhe accused Ciorbea of being incompetent to implement\na harsh, accurate and quick reform. Apart from these issues, street protests\ndemanded for the prime minister to resign. They were all screaming, left, right,\nall televisions, radio stations, and so on: \"Ciorbea is to blame!\"\nCiorbea... Maybe my attempt of being a different\nprime minister was premature. That's how it was meant to be. One year after winning the elections, the Peasants' Party was again in a difficult position. They needed another expert\nto be a prime minister. They chose Radu Vasile, a university professor who joked around\nwhen asked about reform forecasts. So in August there will be a large eclipse... And we hope, and I predict it will be on August 11th. Come on, quit it with those questions! He was utterly incompetent. A nice man, but utterly incompetent. He was teaching the history of the economy\nat the ASE (Academy of Economic Studies). He was clueless! I think so too. God rest his soul, but I think so too. He was a kind man, member\nof the Peasants' Party. From the opposition, right?\nAgainst communism! We finally have honest people, right? I was going to interview him, because we had serious issues with the economy, And he was playing chess. May he rest in peace, he played chess on\nthe computer, in the Government office. I'd say: \"I have to ask you about this ...\" He'd say \"Just a minute, I have a thing here...\" And he kept on playing chess. It's true. But it wasn't chess, it was computer games. The man had no clue about economy. Romania was in economic crisis,\nI showed him all the defining factors of a crisis, looking at what was happening, with numbers, in the economy and he'd refuse to acknowledge it. He'd say: \"No, sir, that's not true, actually!\" In this context, it's appropriate to show\nthat slowing down of reforms, in the second half of 1997, had the effect of lowering the country's rating by\nMoody's, Standard & Poor's. Romania was then on the verge of\ndefault. Because, under Radu Vasile, it wasn't badly governed,\nit wasn't governed at all. That was a critical moment The Mineriad of 1999 happened\non the backdrop of people's disillusionment. Brothers, our patience has come to an end! In January 1999, determined to ask for higher wages\nand to stop the closure of underperforming mines 15,000 miners went, once again,\nto Bucharest, led by Miron Cozma. At the Cotroceni Palace The owl sings The goatee and his mates Are in deep trouble! In Costești, Vâlcea county,\nthey were met by the Gendarmerie. Go ahead! Numerically superior, the miners broke\nlaw enforcement's wall and took hundreds of prisoners, including the Vâlcea county prefect. The President declared a state of emergency, and a march was organized in Bucharest\nagainst the action of the miners and in defense of democracy. The country was on the verge of civil war. If the violence of the miners will continue, Romania will have no future ahead. Jiu Valley, are you happy with this response, yes or no? Noooo! At that time, Emil Constantinescu was hated! These people in government were detested, hated,\nby the vast majority of the population. This is what Miron Cozma counted on when he brought the miners to Bucharest. Obviously, in agreement with the PRM\n(Greater Romania Party) of Vadim Tudor, in agreement with the PSD\n(Social Democratic Party) On behalf of the PRM group,\nsenator Corneliu Vadim Tudor. If in 1989 it was an anti-communist revolution, in 1999 we are dealing with\nan anti-mafia revolution. With the miners advancing towards Bucharest, Prime Minister Radu Vasile gave up and\nmade peace with Miron Cozma's people. Hello. The talks have\nstarted five to six minutes ago between the government delegates\nled by Prime Minister Radu Vasile and the leaders of the miners at Cozia Monastery. The Prime Minister essentially surrendered\nto a group which undermined the state. And accepted all their claims. The mines were no longer closed and continued to operate at a loss for many years after that. Now, looking towards West, Romania reflects upon itself. Romania rediscovers its identity. Despite the huge domestic issues, the CDR government and Emil Constantinescu's\nterm left some positive things in history. Following the 1996 elections, Romania's foreign policy followed\nconsistently two main objectives: becoming a member of NATO\nand the EU. It was ... \"the Americans had finally come.\" And I think it was Pro TV saying: \"Let's look towards the West every night!\" And the idea was: \"We'll join NATO, because\nClinton came here and said: Stay the course, stay the course!\" And people said: \"Yeah, we want to join\nNATO and we'll do anything!\nNATO, NATO, NATO...\" Let's do it together! Only together we can succeed! Romania wanted to join NATO,\nbut NATO was telling us we're not ready. In 1997, at the Madrid Summit, we were told there's still much progress to be made, and the most important was reforming the Army. Even so, history was on our side. Dear compatriots, together with the Romanian Government\nand with the will of the people, I follow with great care and natural concern the evolution of the conflict in Kosovo. In 1999, the war in Kosovo broke out and NATO\nreached out to Romania, as backwards as it was. NATO's planes needed the\napproval of the Romanian state to transit the airspace and reach former Yugoslavia. I had to go to Parliament to\nbe granted the flyover for NATO. In reality, for the USA. Emil Constantinescu did this despite public opinion\nin Romania being pro-Serbia. And because of that, in the fall of 1999, Tony Blair came to Bucharest. And then I said, \"Tony, thank you for coming, it's important for NATO, but we in Romania have a saying: if someone gives you a finger, you ask for their whole hand.\" And I said \"we know what NATO is now,\nthis isn't our main issue anymore.\" \"Our key issue is becoming\na member of the EU\". And he said, \"Okay.\" We joined the EU thanks to the people\nwho died in Yugoslavia. Until then, Iliescu had\nbeen toiling with Mitterrand, talking to the socialists in his circles. Nobody paid attention to us!\nThey didn't even consider it! The EU was even\nmore difficult than NATO! We had no support from anyone in the EU. Absolutely no one! And Tony Blair came and within a week, Romania\nwas on its course to join the EU. That's the real story of what happened. We weren't allowed to join the EU because we were beautiful, charming, faithful, or because we had great\npoliticians who got us there. Chapter 6\nSleep peacefully! I sold my flat and I deposited\nthe cash just for the three months and now I was supposed to get it back! And when I wanted to withdraw\nthe money, this happened. At the beginning of 2000, Romania was facing\nyet another social and economic shock: the collapse of the FNI\n(National Investment Fund). My boy sold both the truck and the trailer. He sold the cow and the calf. So he could buy a tractor at some point. I put it (the money) in there!\nThere it is! A nation of romantics.\nFull of dreams. The FNI was the latest invention\nfrom a long series of scams who lured Romanians in\nduring the transition years. The ads became more attractive,\nbut the recipe was the same: people deposited money in the Fund and were expecting returns up to\nfour times higher than any regular bank. Sleep peacefully while FNI works for you. The National Investment Fund.\nIt's part of your life. Behind this scheme was\nSorin Ovidiu Vîntu who, in the meantime, graduated\nfrom smuggling goods from Turkey to much more complex operations. Why did they call you in? For the accusation of ... ...money laundering. As expected, the FNI collapsed. Over 300,000 people realised\nthat while they were sleeping peacefully, their savings evaporated. All they could do was\ntake to the streets and shout their despair Thieves! Thieves! Damn you all! You should all go to hell! 70% are retired and poor! It took many years for Sorin\nOvidiu Vîntu to pay for his actions. In prison, he met people who\nlost money through the FNI. Many.. And I showed them how not to get\nscammed by institutions like mine. The crash of the FNI occurred during the last\nsix months of the CDR governance. It was the final blow to the huge hopes\nRomanians had in 1996. People didn't expect any miracles, but they were expecting more... honesty. So people were very generous with that coalition and\ntrusted them with their vote, but the coalition didn't\nknow what to do with it. The worst thing was the moral bankruptcy of the opposition that came into power. What do you mean?\nWhy? What happened then? I don't see where, I would need to understand how\nmy administration failed morally. The FNI scandal. At the heart of this scandal\nwas a certain Camenco Petrovici, head of CEC (building society),\nand member of the Peasants' Party. That man made a deal with Vîntu\nthat on those taglines with \"Sleep peacefully, FNI works for you\",\nthe CEC symbol would also appear. CEC was a brand. We want our money back! The CEC guaranteed the payments. Vîntu said: \"You get the money,\nI'll get you a satisfactory profit.\" And the CEC said:\n\"Yes, that's fine, I'll guarantee this!\" That's what happened there: a state-owned bank\nbecame guarantor for a Ponzi Scheme. And this was done by a member of the Peasants' Party. That's one example, indeed. It was a... ... an act signed by Prime Minister Radu Vasile. It was a completely wrong thing to do. The first decade of democracy\nended in an atmosphere of despair. The young people who made the\nRevolution happen were no longer young, and there was nothing left of their passion. There isn't a child who died in the revolution who wouldn't say, \"Mother, did I die in vain?\" They'd be turning in their graves. I ask for forgiveness from all those who\nhoped they'd live better, but continued to suffer. Before the 2000 elections, Emil Constantinescu announced\nthat he won't be running for a second term and opened the door to the most unpredictable\nelectoral struggle after the Revolution. The Romanians were once deceived, but this won't work a second time, this manoeuvring of those in power. At the end of 2000, Ion Iliescu\nwas back in full energy, while the parties on the right proved incapable\nof building a coalition to support a candidate. Me, Isarescu, Melescanu, Roman... ...who else did I mention? Me, Isarescu, Melescanu, Roman. Whatever. And while some were counting their candidates,\nthe voters' attention was focused somewhere else Vadim, get the country out of trouble, Vadim! Vadim! Vadim! He had a nationalistic aggression\nthat was out of the ordinary. He would connect with all types of nationalist feelings. WE LOVE YOU\nVADIM And, for a people who lived 40 years\nin total political illiteracy, this was effective. Come on man, not only I'm a communist, I was born and raised in the\ncommunist spirit, for Christ's sake! I had a home, I had everything. Now I'm starving, fuck them! After 10 years, people\nstarted to lose their patience. And then they said,\n\"Go on then, let's go with this guy\" \"At least he's loud, determined.\" People turned in 2000 towards\ndetermined people. And Vadim seemed like someone who\ntalks and points to this ...mafia! The country was largely run by gangsters. And I have the courage to say that. They stole with impunity, with four\nhands, like a Rahmaninov concert. They stole and moved the money abroad. Vadim didn't just bring his own electorate, but he also brought a lot of young voters who said, \"I'll vote for him because he's crazy!\" I confess that in 2000 I voted for Vadim exactly on those considerations. What were the reasons to vote\nfor Corneliu Vadim Tudor? His extremism. I appreciate it. He's got guts. I like the nationalist style. Rather than having any relations\nwith European countries, to join the EU, better to stay in Romania, to have our own salary. He thinks like I do. \"I VOTED FOR HIM\nBECAUSE HE'S CRAZY\" Over three million Romanians used the\nthe same logic and voted for Corneliu Vadim Tudor who went to the second round with Ion Iliescu. We're strong! This is an earthquake! For the whole world, not just for Romania! Romania shocked the western world again. A candidate full of communist nostalgia\nand with extremist speeches, was one step away from\nbecoming president. Romania can only be run with a rifle! He wanted machine guns on the stadiums, \"I'll execute them with machine guns\non the stadium, no problem.\" He was making lists, he made a list: \"people who will be shot as\nsoon as we come into power.\" More than a decade after the Revolution, Romania was once again considering Ion Iliescu a saviour. Iliescu is fair! The press and civil society\nunited against the danger of Vadim Tudor, urging people to choose the lesser evil. I welcome the gesture of solidarity in the face of threats to democracy ... Ion Iliescu won the elections by a landslide\nand became a president again. It's time to reconcile. It's time to unite. Four years followed\nin which Ion Iliescu took a step back and watched over the rise of his political successor. Adrian Nastase, the new\nPrime Minister of Romania, came from the young wing of the communist structures which, after the Revolution, joined\nthe FSN and later Iliescu's PDSR. He was seen as a man able\nto reform the party, and in the early 2000s he took this role seriously. He changed the name to PSD,\nsurrounded himself with youth, and set for his government objectives\nwhich suggested the party finally broke with the past. The new PSD is the only force capable of building the new Romania. Determined steps were being taken\ntowards NATO and the EU, and foreign investors were\nencouraged to come to Romania. The so-called cardboard capitalists,\nthe first big investors had proven incapable of managing\nanything beyond a family business. And it was necessary to join the structures of globalization, foreign investments, and so on. Foreign investments also meant privatizing\nlarge state-owned companies, such as Petrom and Sidex Galați. I'm glad that the privatization of Petrom is not just a regular transaction\nof selling state assets. It's very important to emphasize\nthat this isn't just a stock sale, today's contract is,\nfirstly, a partnership with a reliable investor. Basically, Sidex had losses\nof a million dollars a day, which represented unpaid wages. Of course we could've kept\ndoing that, but the EU said: \"Well, this is a subsidy, right?\nWe can't agree with that.\" Same with Petrom and so on. Many complain because we privatized Petrom, but when I privatized it,\nit had a debt of 30 billion lei. Foreign investments weren't just about\ncontroversial privatizations. On buildings in big cities, logos of\nwestern corporations start to appear. In the early 2000s, Romania sees it's first economic\ngrowth after the fall of communism. The world saw Adrian Nastase as\na guy who's in control. And after the democratic government\nwhich was a total chaos and when no one seemed to be in control of anything, he became a landmark. He stabilized the economy,\ninflation went down. What was wrong, of course, was the Nastase Government enabling the corruption. In terms of the level of corruption\nthe 90's now seemed fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. Someone, at one point,\nwanted to come and count my chickens, I suggested, they'd better count my eggs\n(euphemism for testicles) Under the Adrian Nastase government, corruption became so visible that it\ncouldn't be concealed anymore. And he knew it too. The slogan \"Năstase, Four Houses\",\nit's when these things started ... It's true that I owned four houses,\nbut not at the same time. Basically, no fraud\nor major issues were found. They found issues with the PVC windows\nthat I, presumably, received as a gift. Electoral posters or hats. Or Mitrea painting a flat or something. These were different times, different attitudes. I was leading the Prime Minister's Control Body. In 2001-2004, nobody really knew what integrity and transparency meant. They all had companies, contracts, uncles, cousins. There was a statement from Miron Mitrea, who was looked into later on, because\nsomeone repaired his mother's house. And Mitrea rightly said: \"At that time, not only it was legal for\nsome company to repair your home for free\" \"but all companies wanted to\nrepair my mother's home.\" That's when the local barons began to appear. Mischie was a beacon of corruption.\nIn Gorj, I think. Why do you have this reputation? Because, not by coincidence, many people start\nwith Mischie when they talk about local barons. Please explain that, honestly. The explanation is clear: because, in Gorj County I identified my activity\nwith the activity of the whole county, of the entire population. Yes, nothing moves without Mischie! No, it's not \"nothing moves\"!\nStop referring to the past It doesn't mean, that if you have authority,\neveryone needs to fall in line. The PSD had a character like him\nall across Romania. I have the honor and the pleasure\nto invite you to take a virtual tour to introduce you to the county of Vrancea so dear to me. The barons ruled the counties and\nsecured votes for the party. In return, the party supplied them\nwith protection from the Justice Dept. It didn't exist back then, the idea\nthat a politician can be tried or convicted. I remember, the story then was\nthat politics controls the justice system. At the top of this system, Adrian Nastase found himself\nwith no apparent way forward. He needed the local barons' influence, but, at the same time, he committed\nto taking Romania into Europe. So he found a Romanian solution. Adrian Nastase tried to reconcile two elements that are somewhat irreconcilable. Externally all appeared in order, we have\nlaws, institutions that function properly, we have a separation of powers within\nthe state, an independent justice system. But, domesticaly, he was faking all these things, either through the people he\nplaced at the top of the system, or through his design of legislation. In the fall of 2002, The Nastase Government seemed to not\ntolerate corruption and established a dedicated institution. 30 prosecutors,\n170 Judicial Police officers and 45 specialists, form the\nNational Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office of Romania. The NAP was set up at EU's request. And Nastase accepted it\nand said: \"Yes, we'll set it up.\" But it had no substance and,\nworse, it had ulterior motives. Of course, the West\nfigured this out and said: \"Big fish aren't getting caught,\nthey're still getting away with it!\" Yes, they really thought they could trick them.\nThat's what Nastase did He tried to give the appearance\nof a normal, functioning society, but in fact, he damaged it as much as he could, with the manoeuvres he was\ndoing behind the scenes. They say I didn't love NAP,\nI had no fondness towards it. Let's be serious, these are jokes. The NAP was built to hand\nout DPs (Don't Prosecute), They blocked criminal\nprosecution for all the big fish. We cannot, at this stage, deal with\nmid and large scale corruption because this institution is already at capacity. The institution was in early stages and I don't think\nwe could've expected extraordinary results. After four years at the head of the Government, Adrian Nastase created the\nimage of an almighty leader, the man who decides everything,\nwho everyone had to obey. - Who's the goalkeeper?\n- It's me. Florin! Make sure you don't catch the ball! Did you choose your corner? With claps on demand and\nalways surrounded by admirers, Adrian Nastase paraded unchallenged\naround Romania during those years. The next step in his political career\nwas obvious and seemed within reach. I'm absolutely convinced\nthat I'll win the presidential election. His path to Cotroceni seemed to\nbe without obstacles. Decimated after the failures of\nthe Constantinescu period, The opposition now rallied\nin a \"Justice and Truth\" coalition, and was gambling everything on a candidate\nwho seemed at the end of his rope. It's an alliance that declared\nzero tolerance for corruption. He was sick, he was depressed,\nI don't know for sure ... But, he simply couldn't\ndeliver a speech to the end. How I ended up in this strange situation ... At the end of 2002, I had a very\ndifficult surgery during which I lost a kidney. I had to go through recovery,\nI didn't really do it properly. Then it was 2004, and I was\nin a state of exhaustion both physically and mentally. Unfortunately, my journey in\nthe presidential race ends here. My health prevents me from\npursuing this further. The start of the campaign\nwas only a few weeks away, and, suddenly, the presidential\nelections became unpredictable. To replace Stolojan, enters a character more gifted\nfor the demands of an election campaign. Dear Stolo ... Of course, this was all an act,\nso well played, that he fooled everyone \"Dear Stolo... Thank you!\" That's it, \"Dear Stolo.\" Yes, yes, with tears, wiping them\nwith the back of the palm ... tricks! If your spirit will stay with us, The Alliance will win. Thank you! A politician who can be such a good actor\nis very difficult to stop. We were dismayed. \"Wow, Traian Basescu is crying? What...\" I think it was the first time when\nhe was emotional in public. I believe those tears were sincere. Basescu is an emotional guy.\nHe cried several times. Especially when reciting his own poetry. He's a kind of an... ... emotional thug. And so I think those tears,\nwere a bit stimulated for effect, but I think, for the most part, they were honest. Yes, he's a sensitive man. He's been through a lot in his life,\nbut he had a moment when... Look, I also tear up sometimes... I don't know... I don't remember exactly, but,\nduring one of those tear-jerker movies... You felt like you were about to cry... Ah, Love Story, right? Love Story ... I felt embarrassed when I saw that,\nin fact, he didn't have any health issues, because I gave him a call then,\nafter the episode with Basescu's tears, and I was genuinely concerned, I thought\nhe had cancer, he has to go abroad for treatment. From a human perspective, I felt sorry for him. Then I realized\nthat it was just a television show and that made me sad about him. I regret that I am forced to see, once again, how low Traian Basescu can go\nto achieve his political aim. From being a definite winner, Adrian Nastase found himself in a competition\nwith unknown rules. A campaign of fighting to the death followed. Romania, wake up! Nobody does anything,\nAnd we're living in poverty now Traian Basescu! President of the Social Democratic Party,\nMr. Adrian Nastase! The bunny Traian is wandering\nthrough the country and shouts: \"Where's the bear so I can eat his ears?\" I'll take this bunny by the ears\nand I'll slam him to the ground. Burn the corrupt and the liars with your vote! Adrian Nastase, my heart! He has good judgement and\ndoes everything well. I only trust him and no one else. He has beauty and a power given by\nGod to lead the people. My hope is bound to\nTraian Basescu's nomination. Basescu is a man who\nreally cares about people, and people feel it and\nlove him, in return. The confidence he inspires makes many\nsee him as chosen, a saviour, and to say: To me, he is like a knight of justice. I don't know, he simply inspires trust. Live well! I was campaigning with him and I noticed\nthe impact he had on people. I got rid of the mafia! I had other ideas about what\nit means to be a leader. Of course, I was criticised for not being out in\nthe streets, to shake hands with people. During the campaign, I did that too. But I think that a leader,\nfirstly, has to be in the office, go to the command posts, to build. But people said: \"Well, he is very arrogant, very arrogant!\" Or to be voted by the people you have to be empathetic, you need leadership skills\nand be able to talk to people. How could you go and kiss old women? To be relatable, to promise things?! Nastase was stiff, uptight. Do you know what Basescu was? He was the wise guy of the 80's. In the '80s, there were these wise guys who were part of the system, but were not party apparatchiks. These were usually Security collaborators\nwho knew what was going on. More \"liberal\" guys, with quotation marks,\nwho had a bit of foreign currency and so on. That's why Basescu was much more\nversatile than Adrian Nastase. You don't do autographs, do you? Yes, ma'am, I do, but they're useless. If that's how I feel like ... Basescu had human defects: he liked to drink, he liked women, he'd talk to people in their own language. There are urban legends he\ngot into a fight in a market. That's it, Romanians wanted a president like that.\nWhat could I do, contradict them? Basescu was the man\nwho could infuriate Nastase. I couldn't. My dialogue with Nastase\nwould've been something like: \"You promised you'd build\n100 km of highway and you didn't, right?\" And isn't it how it should be? Was it better to fool around and...? Go! Live well! Exceptional! OK, I told you I'm smart? At one point, Basescu was on a talk show. And the host asks him: \"What are you\ngoing to do to Nastase if you win?\" Basescu replied:\"I'll catch him and\nI'll slam his head against the walls!\" Which Romania the next day found really funny. He had this thing I didn't have. If I were to say that, it\nwould've sounded terrible. And he was saying: \"I will impale him\nin Victoria Square! I'll slam him around!\" Some empty words with no substance. But they were working! A wretched system that destroys\nthe political opponents of the Power, Well, guys, you won't destroy me! In Victory Square with\nspikes, after November 28th! The last fight between\nNastase and Basescu was the debate before the\nsecond round of elections. Basescu proved once again\nthe most versatile politician, when discussing the most\nsensitive issue at the time. We both have a big problem. On my word of honor, let's discuss this honestly. How cursed can this nation be, that in the end, it has to choose between two former communists? Between Adrian Năstase and Băsescu. In 15 years, there wasn't one person who\ncame from this world instead. Who wasn't tainted by communism,\nor tained in some way. What kind of curse could this be? On my word, I feel sorry. That was a sketch. Mr. Basescu's main concern\nbefore this show was to find the silver bullet. and he thought that this\nwould be the silver bullet, right? Those cheap theatrics, right? Of a stale countryside \"Can you imagine Adrian how cursed this nation has to be to have to choose ...\" As in, he had this dilemma,\nhe was wondering. In front of the people, he\nwas torn by this question. He couldn't care less about\nhe people and communism and all that. But he thought: \"Let's see how I\ncan make this difficult for him?\" And then I sometimes looked in the mirror. I look at myself, and say: \"Do you respect the Romanian\npeople, Basescu?\", I was wondering. I say, \"I do!\" \"I look in the mirror, dear Adrian,\nand I wonder, sometimes ...\", you know? Almost like a character from cheap play. It was like we were living in this theatre production. A two-cent rhetoric, a circus. The drama is that we're not allowed to have the same mindset after 15 years since communism\nno longer exists in Romania. I hope... And you convince me every day that you're unable to understand\nthat these institutions need to be independent. Nastase showed his from the\nold generation, uptight, rigid. He couldn't handle the situation. So that's where he lost, he clearly lost. I admit I didn't consider it to be\nvery important because of course, I could've easily replied: I was a party member,\none of the four million, while you were actually a party apparatchik. Because, basically, you got your title\nwith Elena Ceaușescu's signature in Antwerp. Some would say it wasn't\na choice between a party member and an apparatchik. They'd say that\nhe was also a member of the Security... \"Dear Petrov\", as some call Basescu today. Perfect equality. The two candidates, in the second round\nof the presidential elections cannot be delimited, with the current estimates. It's a result for 7pm, and the polling stations are filled\nwith the Alliance's young constituents. Adrian, you don't even know\nhow small you start to look! On the evening of December 12, 2004, Traian Basescu became the president of Romania. The result was so surprising, that Adrian Nastase couldn't\navoid the ridicule of a big celebration which the party had prepared long before. Nastase! Nastase! Thank you for being together with us! I'm sure we will win! Victory! Victory! Victory! Nastase! Nastase! All this time, the centre of the capital\nwas occupied by Traian Basescu's supporters. After another eight years,\nRomanians took to the streets again, putting all their hopes in one man. Basescu! Silviu Brucan said we needed\n20 years to reach democracy. You, with your vote, shortened the term to 15 years. Romania reached democracy 5 years earlier! Live well! Chapter 7\nBasescu I swear to use all my power and abilities for the spiritual and material prosperity\nof the Romanian people... On December 20th, 2004, Traian Basescu was formally\naccepting the highest title in the Romanian state. He was the first post-revolution president to win the election on a promise of a better life, and a country where the laws\nwill be the same for all, from the regular citizen to\npoliticians and businessmen. Basescu was, suddenly, a traitor, in relation to the world which he came from. He betrayed his colleagues at\nFSN and the previous party. And what did he do? He noticed that the focus of the public opinion was the fight against corruption that became\na blah-blah for everyone. But to him that meant this: the birth of a justice system that could attack,\nlegally speaking, anyone who stepped outside the law. The fight against corruption must be fought by the justice system,\nwhich must be depoliticized immediately. He won the election with this speech,\nso he had to deliver something. It was Traian Basescu's main concern\nat the beginning of his term. At the first meeting of the\nSupreme Council for Defense, corruption was declared a national security issue. At the same time, Basescu would overstep his duties\nand choose the new Minister of Justice himself. The proposal to be the Minister of Justice found me doing the dishes on Christmas day. My mother cooked and I was doing the dishes. \"Hello, this is Traian Basescu.\" I never spoke to him before,\nwe didn't know each other. The argument that convinced me was the following: a man from a political party will never be able to to reform the justice system properly\nand fight against political corruption. Because, in the meantime,\nparty members helped each other out. They could say, \"But we made you a minister, so why am I or them being investigated?\" And they'd interfere with the investigations. It was best to be someone who\nknew no one in the party. After being appointed, Monica\nMacovei was given the freedom to bring in new people to manage the\nmost important prosecution office. Daniel Morar was promoted to the lead\nof the National Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office, and Laura Codruța Kovesi became\nGeneral Prosecutor of Romania. It was a message that a wind of change\nwas blowing through the justice system. In essence, it gave some magistrates\nthe freedom to act as experts, to stop being under political pressure,\nas they had been until 2004. When everyone knew that you wouldn't\nopen a lawsuit without the party approving it. DNA began the prosecution\nagainst George Copos, the general director of the Lottery, Nicolae Cristea, and one of the Ana Electronics shareholders, Rosa Giglio Giuseppe. The three are suspected of tax\nevasion and official misconduct. Prosecutors have begun a criminal investigation\nagainst the then-Deputy Prime Minister, George Copos. And, coincidentally, the day when DNA\nannounced it would begin to prosecute him was when I went to see a play in the afternoon. I've set up my phone to silent and,\nwhen I got out of there, after two hours, I think I had about 50 missed calls. It was crazy! I didn't imagine it would generate such\nan interest at such an early stage. After all, it was the beginning of the\ninvestigations against a man, it didn't mean much... He wasn't arrested, tried or convicted. But in the end, it became obvious\nwhy there was this kind of interest: he was the Deputy Prime Minister, and this kind of thing hadn't\nhappened in Romania before then. Well, the phone calls were from... everyone. And the Government meeting was about to start.\nWhen I entered the room, everyone was looking at me very doubtful. Their eyes said: \"We have our Minister of Justice in our own government and\nwe're being investigated?\" That's what their looks said. It's something that never happened before. Tariceanu says: \"Monica, I thought\nwe're going after the opposition!\" \"That we're going after the opposition ...\" And I said, \"We don't go after anyone! Prosecutors investigate based on evidence.\" Copos was shouting at me over the\ntable that he'll never speak to me again I said \"Okay.\" If they find anything illegal,\nthey should prosecute, if not, they should apologize. Personally, I don't feel startled,\nI have no fear and no doubt regarding the outcome of the investigations. Tariceanu, however, said: \"It's unacceptable for a member of the government\nto be investigated and for me not to be informed.\" \"So you need to find a channel\nthrough which I can find out in advance.\" And then I said, \"You won't find out in advance!\" It was a small statement of independence\nfor the beginning of DNA. It does something that politicians\nknow nothing about. But the game was not just about politicians. There were also the big businessmen behind them, controversial characters such as:\nDinu Patriciu, Sorin Ovidiu Vîntu and Dan Voiculescu. Madam Prosecutor, do you hear me? Madam Minister Macovei is here with us. No, I was talking to the prosecutor Macovei. She's listening,we're hearing you well.. You hear me, yes? Madam Prosecutor, where\nis all this hypocrisy coming from, all this acting? Like you're some innocent girl,\nwith no sins, nothing is out of place, you're all clean,\nyou and President Basescu. We, the oligarchs, are bastards, are evil. immaterial of how much we've done\nfor Romania, objectively. Where is the justice reform\nthat you keep mentioning? Madam Prosecutor Ceausescu. Mr. Voiculescu, Mrs. Macovei is my\nguest and she said she feels insulted. Well done to you, Mrs. Gabi Firea,\nwith your guests and everything... It's OK, I can handle this. Handle it, Mrs. Macovei! And you should stop the acting because the people of Romania are not stupid. Owning the most influential\nnewspapers and television channels, the transition oligarchs reacted harshly\nto Basescu's anti-corruption offensive. They all knew that a free justice\nsystem would, sooner or later, investigate how they gained their assets. I think it already reached some of them.\nPatriciu was already targeted. It was in 2005 when Tariceanu wrote the note:\n\"Traian, see if you can do something about this.\" The ICA case investigation\nalready begun for Voiculescu, Vîntu also had enough going on\nto be afraid of getting caught. They were afraid, I think, not so much\nof Basescu instigating prosecutors against them, but that Basescu wasn't\ninterfering with the prosecutors. Or would control them on a very small scale,\nstrictly in regards to people around him. And that he'd leave everyone else out in\nthe cold, at the mercy of the prosecutors. The hatred he aroused\nin the political class was enormous. and Basescu became the number one enemy of the coalition between\nbusinessmen and politicians. On April 19, 2007, the Parliament voted for\nTraian Basescu to be suspended. The initiators of this decision were the\nones most troubled by the idea of anti-corruption. At least one of them, Dan Voiculescu, presided over the commission\nthat investigated Basescu and his numerous violations of the Constitution. Voiculescu didn't even hide that he\nwas the initiator of that suspension. Traian Băsescu violated the Romanian Constitution and Traian Basescu is involved in criminal acts. One of us will lose and that won't be me. Basescu! Basescu! At the 2007 referendum,\nTraian Basescu had the citizens on his side. 74% of Romanians voted against the suspension\nand Basescu returned to Cotroceni. A term in which the president\nconsistently pursued the great themes of his voters, even when it forced him to turn against the\nsystem which he came from. I found in this document the reasons why I can condemn the communist regime. In December 2006, based on a report\ncreated by a group of historians, Traian Basescu condemned the communist regime\nin a special session of Parliament. It was a moment that proved that the\nghosts of the past were still haunting us. What happened in 2007,\nwhen he read in Parliament the speech which condemned\ncommunism, was staggering. I was in the room. They're threatening to throw us from the balcony! In that room, a howl of beasts broke out. They brought in their supporters, Vadim Tudor was holding protest signs, howling, everyone was shouting. This is not GDS (Group for Social Dialogue)!\nThis is the Parliament! Who are you, you pig? How dare you talk to me like that? Please help us! Ceausescu was big compared to you,\nyou are just some poor... What are you talking about? We're not afraid of three nobodies! The communist regime in Romania\nwas illegal and criminal! Can I continue ... You tramp! Someone touched on the taboo issue - how can they condemn something which\nthemselves represented and still represent? Leaving Communism behind, on January 1st, 2007, Romania becomes\nofficially a member of the EU. Welcome to the EU!\nWelcome home 6 ... 5... 4... 1... 0! In the main cities, the EU membership is celebrated\nin the streets, with music and high hopes. A better world, more money! Let alcohol get cheaper for my friend, Giani. We congratulate the EU for being\nvery understanding with us and for helping us a lot. It will be a bit worse and\nthen it will be a lot better! Europe, you are mine! We're trying to run a small\nfarm, goats and cows. Now that we're in the EU we\nhope we can get some funding. So we can develop this as much as possible. In rural areas, the peasants began\nto dream of European funds, but they learned that EU membership\nalso brought complex issues. If they want us to do it as the EU wants, they will ask us to milk a cow in a white suit, like a doctor entering an operating theatre! There's no such thing on the field!\nYou can't do something like that! The European community is not this bottomless bag,\nwhere we can open our mouths and keep eating. On the contrary: it comes with high demands, it requires work, discipline and order. There won't be any better living conditions.\nGas, electricity, they're all expensive. We are living hand to mouth. In the Brussels meetings, Romania was praised\nfor the progress it made to join the EU. It had new institutions, better laws,\nwas fighting corruption and connecting to Western markets. But we entered Europe\nwith a problem as big as the continent. Much of the country was submerged\nin underdevelopment. But these issues remained far removed\nfrom the political agenda. The 2009 elections focused on the battle between\nTraian Basescu and the moguls who wanted to defeat him. The fate of the elections was not\ndecided by policy, but by a visit the PSD candidate\nmade to Sorin Ovidiu Vîntu. I don't like Mr. Vîntu either\nand it seems that neither do you. You didn't like him last night? And, taking into account ... Mr. Geoană, did you not enjoy your\nmeeting with Mr. Vîntu last night? Last night, when he learned that\nMr. Popa Nicolae, his FNI partner, was arrested? Did he call you for an emergency? Mr. Basescu ... Did he call you for an emergency? Mr. Geoana ... Mr. Traian Basescu, please ... So what happened between me and Geoana,\nwhy he came over, is between me and Geoana It's not for the public. I considered that, for me,\nas a citizen, Mr. Basescu is a threat. I, the citizen, not Sorin Ovidiu Vîntu! That's why, with everything I had,\nI entered a fight against Basescu. He defeated me. That's it. Mihaela, my love, thank you! The results in round two were so close that\nMircea Geoană believed, for one night, to be the president of Romania. It's a beautiful night for Romanian democracy! What do you feel at the moment, Mr. President? I can't believe it. What could I feel? Joy and a kind of relief. Towards morning, it turned out that Traian Basescu\nwas ahead by a few tens of thousands of votes and was going to rule Romania for the next five years. I want to summarize the result of these elections: We won! Instead of knocking him down,\nthe moguls served him his main campaign issue. It was the second time when\nBasescu won the elections by exploiting the greatest frustration\nof the post-revolution society: the enormous degree of corruption. His second term at Cotroceni meant a\nDNA that revved its engines further. The DNA removed many corrupt people from\nthe system, for years in a row. And it was expected to. There are people who can't justify\ntheir income at all and their whole lives were part of the system,\nwith access to public funds. And they can't possibly justify\ntheir standard of living. Properties, cars,\nholidays, their income. Sweetheart, no one made their fortune honestly. That's clear. It's a reality, unfortunately for Romania. Do you think you can make a\nfortune of one hundred million euros? In any country, in just a few years,\nstarting from nothing? If your name's Bill Gates or you discover the\ncure for cancer, OK, you can, but otherwise you can't. And then, yes, people interested\nin current affairs, they feel that there's an injustice here, that these guys\nare corrupt, they steal from us. Is anyone ever going sort this out?! The politician became so callous\nthat someone had to stop this. DNA ended up doing this and began to\nseize in droves the products of Romanian corruption. People who seemed unassailable, intangible. There was a period when these\npeople were frightened. And fear is good, it keeps thieves at bay. And I told them: \"Be careful! I can't see what all of you are doing!\" And if DNA catches you,\nyou can't come to me for help because I can't do anything about it.\" Fear was good. He is! In 2012, former prime minister Adrian Nastase\nwas the first of many politicians convicted of corruption. Unable to accept the guilt and humiliation of imprisonment, Nastase resorted to an extreme gesture. Former Prime Minister Adrian Nastase will go into surgery\nthis morning. Doctors say his condition is stable. He tried to kill himself when the\npolice tried to take him into custody. I was under a lot of stress and, above all,\nthe humiliation that these actions entailed. I've been to the Supreme Court 200 times. But I don't even want to remember. Maybe\nI became stronger and wiser after these experiences I realised what's important in life,\nI realised what family actually means This type of discourse became unanimous among politicians and businessmen\nthat went to jail for corruption. They all claimed innocence, and prison\nwas portrayed as an exercise in dignity\nagainst great injustices. I couldn't believe these things were happening,\nbut then I said, \"Well, this is life!\" I was trying to think:\n\"Well, where did I go wrong? What did I do wrong?\" Because I have a pretty good opinion of myself. Let justice take its turn... Did you take the 20% commission\nthey are referring to? Look at me! After 15 years, someone comes in\nand arrests me, saying it's because of some bribe. God forbid! The former head of the NKVD used to say: \"Nobody's innocent, there are just\npeople we didn't look into diligently enough.\" And, indeed, this is what the DNA does:\nit sets on a certain target and then ... Well, don't you see? Look here! You saw this coming! Why did they accuse you of? That I took ... They were political trophies. Remember\nthe way they reported those convictions to Brussels. The self-victimization of those\nending up in the DNA cross hairs was also enabled by the media spectacle\nwhich accompanied the wave of lawsuits. Transcripts and information about future arrests\nappeared in the media and gave the impression that prosecutors\nare contributing to this spectacle. Let's be honest, some get picked up\nby the DNA without us knowing about it, while others, you knew they'll end up at DNA before\nthat man would wake up in the morning. In the cold light of day, justice seemed\nto stop being completely blind. Because, occasionally, it would keep\nan eye on people's expectations. You gave them the satisfaction, yes? \"Look, we caught the big corrupt ones.\"\nBlood, blood, circus, bread, blood, blood ... You have to admit that this strategy paid off. We were excited to see politicians\non TV, with handcuffs on ... The thieves are free, Becali is arrested! It would've been nice to be without handcuffs,\nand the TV stations there, and so on. But you know what, I'm human in the end, not a machinery, a computer that analyzes things for you. I liked seeing those people\nin handcuffs, you know? After, for so many years, as a journalist, I wrote, I investigated, I knew and I know very well how\nsinister these individuals were. And for years, I haven't seen a single\none of them taken into custody. They were arrogant.\nThey were mocking us. Everything was in vain, you showed\nthem documents: \"Look!\" I remember sending one of our journalists\nfrom Adevărul (The Truth) to the Government. There was one, Petre something,\nMinister of Commerce, and he had, while Minister of Commerce,\nabout 14 companies in his name. Which he would manage while doing\nhis job as a minister. And I sent the man from Adevărul\nthere, with a printed sheet and said: these are Petre's companies\nfrom the Ministry of Agriculture Commerce or Agriculture, wherever he was! And, the result? Nothing! The man remained in office. \"Eh, so what?\" You see? We accumulated a lot of frustration. Speaking from a human perspective, as a journalist. So I didn't feel sorry for any of those guys\nthat I saw in handcuffs. Pushed from behind by these\nfrustrations accumulated in society, DNA had moments when it seemed\nto be losing its sense of purpose and sees justice as a contest in which\nit must exceed previous performances. There were sent to court five times\nmore ministers and MPs than two years ago. A prime minister, five ministers,\n16 deputies and five senators. Laura Codruța Kovesi led the National\nAnticorruption Directorate between 2013 and 2018. She refused to appear in this documentary,\narguing that she doesn't want to be associated with the people she investigated. The results of DNA during her\nleadership are undeniable and have been recognized internationally. But she also led the institution in a vulnerable area,\nmeeting privately with politicians, businessmen and heads of secret services. With the passage of time, people came\nto look at the DNA with more skepticism and to see more clearly the strengths\nand weaknesses of the institution. You see, this DNA approach is\nnot entirely ethical, either. Because Udrea and Mircea Băsescu\nwere not taken into custody when Traian Basescu was at\nthe peak of his power. No! They were taken in when they were\ndeclining, when they were coming to an end. When this fight against corruption\ngot too close to him: \"Eh, this anti-corruption fight ... let's not ... ... excesses, abuses, let's ... however, be more ... do we want to destroy everything?! \" We know this kind of speech. Why? Because his darling had been taken away, Mrs. Udrea, with Paris and so on. You see, Traian Basescu's quote:\n\"how cursed can we be to have these kinds of politicians.\" What happened to him after that is another story, because the same man who spoke about\nthe great themes of Western democracy began to talk about the others\nas a sort of anti-Basescu agenda. Honestly, if anyone believes Basescu is an\nanti-corruption fighter, they are very naive! For Băsescu, corruption\nwas any business he's not involved in. Through his gang, he tried to slip, and do, to an extent, what everyone else did before him. I still have a great disappointment that after you talk about this mafia Petrache-Bittner-Cocoș, you see the wife of Mr. Cocoș\nbecome an adviser to the president. In his second term, when Traian Basescu gradually\ngave up on his role of anti-corruption hero, people started to remember\nall the defects they had overlooked him. He surrounded himself with dubious characters\nto whom he offered protection, He pushed his daughter into politics,\nalthough she wasn't fit for it. I voted for myself. But above all, Traian Basescu many times behaved not as a president, but as a\nbaron who can break any rule. He gets drunk as a skunk, and\nthen gets behind the wheel. People were shocked:\n\"Ooh, our president is drinking and driving ?! And he said, \"No, there was water in the glass.\" OK ... Well, you voted for him! You knew how he is! It's much worse to be tolerant with the man you believe in\nthan to be intolerant with your enemy. People stopped being tolerant of Traian Basescu when his decisions touched their pockets. Reducing the fund for salaries for all public sector employees in Romania by 25%. Huoooo! We predict a decrease of pensions by 15% ... We voted for you and you betrayed us! Out with Basescu! Out with Basescu! After the protests caused by the income cuts, a new wave followed in 2012 against Basescu and the government led by Emil Boc. We need new ones! So we\ncan at least have some hope ... Damn it! Out with the dictator! Out with the dictator! We have nothing to eat, we have nothing\nto put on the table, the children left the country, you can't live anymore! Romania, wake up! The protests are not without\neffect: without political and popular support Traian Basescu is forced to appoint\na prime minister from the opposition, Victor Ponta. I want to say to the pensioners,\nI want to say to the redundant, I want to say to the poor and disenfranchised, that fighting poverty is a priority\nfor the Romanian Government. But before fighting poverty,\nPSD fought to defeat Basescu for good. In the summer of 2012, the president was\nsuspended again, politicians were against him, but he kept his seat because the\nelectoral threshold of 50% wasn't reached. I believe that the honest thing\nfor Traian Băsescu to do was to resign. Because seven and a half million\npeople voted against you. And, yes, they're not 50% of the electoral rolls, but they're seven and a half million people\nwho voted and said you had to leave. What right do you have to stay? Basescu remained in Cotroceni\nuntil the last day of his term, ending ten years of presidency in which he wasted almost any\nhope that millions of Romanians had and which they trusted him with in early 2000s. The former president didn't accept our invite\nto appear in this documentary, leaving unanswered many questions and\naccusations that marked his two terms. Chapter 8\nFreedom is no longer a burden By exploiting people's anger\nagainst Traian Basescu, PSD is, once again, the most\npowerful political party in Romania. In 2012 they took over the government, and in 2014 they were preparing\nto win the presidential elections. The party's strength was still the network\nof barons from Nastase's term many harassed by Basescu's anti-corruption\nagenda, and fed up with EU regulation. Their frustration pushed the party\ntowards an increasingly nationalist ideology at the centre of which they placed\na young man, Victor Ponta. This is my country and my Romanian nation, And this is where I'd like to die, This is where I want to live, together with you! Victory! Where are the tall oaks The presidential campaign was launched\nin a megalomaniac event on the National Arena. on the day when Ponta was\ncelebrating his 42nd birthday. Of course it was a mistake. A very big one, of course! Because we, the people on the stadium,\nall 70,000 of us, were very happy while outside seven million were cursing at us. Do you do politics for the 70,000\non the stadium or for those outside? It was a big mistake, obviously! We are many because we are good, but we are good, my dear, because we are united. Dragnea told me: \"Let's show strength! Let's show how strong we are,\nthat only we can fill the stadium, and so on\" Victor Ponta managed to upset the people. Because it annoyed them for a long time with lies and arrogance\nand then he did that monstrous thing on the National Arena and people got very angry. See? The sun is coming out on our street! It is! With such a deployment of resources,\nVictor Ponta was the great favorite of the presidential election. His main contender\nhad no experience in top politics and had spent the last 12 years\nin a town hall. I'll call you after lunch, okay? OK, good. Klaus Iohannis was a candidate\nfrom the National Liberal Party, with the promise of a Romania\nheading towards normality. Only the job done right delivers lasting results. If you think the same, let's discover together\na different Romania, a normal Romania. Iohannis didn't run a spectacular election campaign, but he took advantage of Romanians most\npersistent attitude: voting for the lesser evil. Let's see what the Romanians say\nand I ask you, dear Romanians: Are your lives better\nsince Mr. Ponta became our prime minister? I think the Romanians answered\nto this legitimate question of Mr. Iohannis on November 2, when four million\nRomanians voted me for president, If their lives weren't better... Those who voted for you,\nI saw them on social networks last night, they said, \"He's a terribly weak candidate,\nbut we'd rather vote for him than Ponta.\" It was a vote against me, of course, because ... How many votes did he get in the first\nround? 2.8 million, right? So, 2.8 million people liked Klaus\nIohannis and voted for him. After the second round, he got 6 million votes Obviously, the rest of the votes are votes against me. Because of the barons, because \"Don't let PSD\ntake everything!\", because Ponta is arrogant. And especially because Ponta neglected\nsomething all politicians neglected until then. Are you leaving the country for the first time? Yes, it's the first time I leave the country for work.\nI just finished school. During the years when politicians\npursued only their interests and failed to modernise Romania, millions of people, resignedly, had left the country. The migration to Western Europe\nbegan in the late 1990s. Firs, the men left to save some\nmoney and then come back home. They got used to it, and after a while,\nthey brought their families and friends. We, Romanians aged 40-50,\nhad a hard time in Romania: the end of Ceausescu, the beginning of democracy. We had a hard time in Romania, we have\na hard time here, yet we hope things will get better. There is almost no Romanian who, in the initial stage, didn't find this very, very difficult. No one leaves his country because\nthey're doing too well. Most leave because they are worried\nabout the future of their children. I think it will be a new lifestyle and if I have children, even though\nthey'll be half Spanish, I still feel Romanian. Every year, the number\nof those who left was growing. Beyond the borders, a parallel Romania\nappeared, made up of millions of people. We're happy, we integrated\nvery well in this society, in Spain. I spoke with tens of thousands of\npeople from all the countries: Spain, Italy, France, I was in Ireland, in the UK. Do you know what most of them would say? \"The state has betrayed us. The Romanian state has betrayed us.\" A terrible thing to hear. Terrible ... But, you see, this sentence\nsums up all of their pain. I know many of them are very unhappy. Because you can't really break this tie. You can't just get rid of a good chunk of your life. Your childhood, your adolescence,\nit's impossible not to mean anything to you. The smell of lime on your street,\nthe dust on the street where you played etc. In reality, Romanians that left never\nforgot the dust on the street where they grew up. They went home at least on holidays,\nthey sent billions of euros back and sometimes they even\ncontributed to changes of attitudes. These people went West, travelled,\nhave seen another side to the world. These people are much harder to fool. Because they are free, they are\nin touch with Western institutions, they learn this idea that you have rights, that you need to claim your rights. And they're not something given by\nthe state, but something which is yours. These are people much harder to fool\nwhen they come here, to Romania. They still have relatives in the country, they send money to the people back home.\nAnd we know that, as you inject cash in a country, there's an increase in awareness of liberties. So, the emigrants contribute with money,\nand the values they acquire there which they communicate to their\nrelatives when they return. And they ask the remaining families: \"Are you still poor? Still with these guys? You still have nothing? Still no sewage? Still no pavements yet? Roads, highways? I came by train, mom.\nHow can you vote with these people, mom?\" And these are very honest\nagents of electoral influence who are very credible, who talk from their direct\nexperience of living and working in the West. My younger friends, who are,\nat the moment, in England or France, they are glued to what's happening here. Very few of them say: \"I left, I closed that\ndoor, I'm not interested anymore!\" They have two homelands. We want to vote! We want to vote! The 2014 presidential elections was when the Romanians abroad showed\nthey didn't break away from their country. Hundreds of thousands of people\nstormed the polling stations, while the Government, led by Victor Ponta,\nwas overwhelmed by the situation. As you can see, there are many in the queue. Here at the Romanian Consulate in Madrid,\nthe queue is about 100 meters long. The poor logistics for the elections abroad\nand the thousands of Romanias who couldn't vote created a wave of revolt in the country\nwhich changed the fate of the elections. In 2014, it was a second wave\nof what I called the \"enchanted wind\". I couldn't believe it. I think the hurricane effect was due to Romanians from abroad calling\nrelatives back home, telling them not to vote for Ponta. I think that's the only logical explanation for the reverse of the trend between\nthe first round and the second round. Huge anger when you're being fooled\nand you're not allowed to vote. You don't play with that.\nThey played and they lost. Johannis! Johannis! The electorate gave us a very\nstrong message yesterday and I think we must have the decency and the wisdom to keep silent, for a while, all of us. The silence didn't last, and politicians\nquickly forgot the electorate's message. Victor Ponta remained\na prime minister, just as arrogant and surrounded by the same\ncharacters and their attitude of \"masters\". Of these, Deputy\nPrime Minister Gabriel Oprea stood out, accused of misusing the motorcade and of\nhaving caused the death of a young policeman. People went to the streets angry\nwith the politicians' abuse. Ten days later, on October 30, 2015, the fire at the \"Colectiv\" club breaks out. Remove the cars!\nFire, fire in the Pioneer factory! Where, on what street? Tăbăcarilor 7 street, fire in the Pionierul factory. Tăbăcarilor 7? Tăbăcarilor 7, yes, yes! Tăbăcarilor 7, okay? Tăbăcarilor 7! For one night, Romania stood still,\nshocked by the size of the tragedy. 27 dead and over 100 wounded and hospitalized. Authorities declare that the situation is under control. We really don't need anything right now,\nour doctors can handle the situation. We've received offers for help from\nFrance, Germany, and others. Will you accept further help ...? For now, we are doing very well. In the following days, further information\nrevealed the exact opposite. Hospitals didn't have enough burn units, the wounded would die because of hospital infections and the club where the tragedy took place\noperated without a fire permit, and the tacit approval of the authorities. \"We have all the facilities to keep them here.\nWe have everything set up! \" All the politicians have this on their conscience. And then the stake is not to change\nthe consciousness of the villain. That's a lost battle. But to awaken the consciousness\nof those around them and say they're enabling them by\ncohabiting in these decision-making roles. \"Colectiv\" made Romanians more aware than ever\nabout how bankrupt the Romanian state is and the direct effects that\ncorruption has on everyone's life. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets. WE WANT TO BE INFORMED\nNOT MANIPULATED This is what \"Colectiv\" has proven:\n\"They are killing us! We can't do this anymore\" Until \"Colectiv\", people still believed\nthat they can fend for themselves \"Ah, it's fine, they steal, we mind our own lives We're fine. We do well in school, we work in a corporate, maybe we get a job abroad, we can insulate ourselves\nfrom the villains, from the corruption.\" Colectiv proved that we cannot insulate ourselves. And the situation is so serious, that\nyou can die burning alive, like a rat because some bastards\ndidn't check and didn't apply the law! Out with Ponta! It was real anger.\nAnd legitimate, after all. When you see the young people who died. I'm ready to take this step\nthat an important part of society is expecting and, obviously, starting today,\nI resign as a Prime Minister, and implicitly, from the Government of Romania. I spoke with a few people,\ngetting advice about this. People very close to me and whom I trust. And I said, \"I think I should go.\" Not one of them said: \"No, stay there, it's fine, they're\npaid to say these things...\" Not one of them said that. Everyone said: \"Yes, it looks serious. I don't know if\nyou should leave, but this is how it looks.\" Be afraid!\nThe people will rise! The fire at the Colectiv club changed Romania. The death of the 64 people awakened the consciousness of a society\nstarting to acknowledge the burden of freedom. From then on, the protests become\na weapon in the fight for state reform, and Romanians take to the streets\nnot for tangible things, but for ideals. At the time of Colectiv I felt that too. I felt that those people went out\nin the street thinking \"Whatever happens, we're doing this\nbecause we can't stand it anymore!\" That was a moral gesture, I said that at the time. These people didn't go out to ask for\nhigher salaries and pensions, or for some other kind of benefit. No, they went out for an issue\nthat you can't see, touch or smell, it was for a moral, a spiritual issue. Dare to believe in Romania too! My message to all Romanians today is that it's better for all when we're united. Let's dare to believe in Romania, in the strength that everyone has inside them\nto make his country better. I have faith and I'm sure we'll succeed. Happy Birthday Romania!\nHappy Birthday Romanians! After a year in which Romania\nwas led by a government of technocrats, The PSD won the parliamentary\nelections of 2016 and returned to power. Liviu Dragnea, the new party leader,\ncame from the faction of local barons, he had an active sentence and\nseveral ongoing prosecutions. The new Government's first concern was\nan Emergency Ordinance to help rid Dragnea of his troubles with the law. The ordinance was approved\nin a meeting which finished close to midnight. Why did you choose to do\nthis now, in the evening? The timing is set by the Government.\nNext question! Does the Leader of your party, Mr. Liviu\nDragnea, benefit from this change? No changes made ... The change is irrelevant,\nI asked you if he benefits from it. Not... How not to benefit since ...? You might have information from a government file\nI don't have specifics from the file. They're public. I wasn't interested in this data. Tramps! Thieves! Thieves! Next question, if you have one. If you were accused, now that\nit's not possible anymore, right? Do you have another question? You wouldn't answer, right? I answered you, ma'am.\nNext question, if you have one. You didn't answer me, yes or no?\nIt's a simple, closed question, yes or no? I answered, ma'am,\nnext question, if you have one. Yes or no? I answered you ... Thieves! Thieves! Sir, I've asked you ... OK, so we crossed the street illegally, but\ndo you know what they did in there? Go and stop them in the\nmiddle of the street instead. Thieves! Thieves! Next question. Thank you! Thank you! Goodbye! Come on! Come on! Come on! Thieves! Thieves! Florin Iordache is the \"Next question\" guy. With his cheek: \"Next question! Next question!\" That guy, by himself, kept thousands of people\nin the Victory Square for days in a row. And you see him...\nHe's your servant. He's a minister, \"Minister\"\ncomes from Latin and it means \"Subordinate, underling, servant\",\nthat's what \"minister\" means. He's a minister, he's paid from the\nmoney that you worked for. Tomorrow night we'll be a hundred\nthousand and we'll crush them. And if you're here, it'll be bad. Calm down, please. Pray that won't have to work tomorrow,\nbecause tomorrow we will crush them. The following evenings, hundreds of thousands\nof Romanians took to the streets And not just in Bucharest, but across the country. These were the biggest protests in\npost-revolution Romania, and ended in a victory. After a week, the government\nrepealed the emergency ordinance. A war of attrition began\nbetween the street and the politicians who kept trying to change the\nlaws, but with more subtle methods. Romanians reacted with unwavering perseverance and went out as many times as it was needed. Indeed, we've evolved from this perspective. There are now in Romania, many more people\nthan in 1990, who take their freedom seriously. What does that mean? It means an inner strength\nto go out on the street of your own accord, without being manipulated or paid by anyone. The fact that, on an issue as abstract as Justice, or the laws of justice,\nCriminal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, people reacted and\nunderstood exactly what this is about, and so many came out it's an\nextremely surprising, beneficial maturing. Belated, in fairness, but probably it couldn't have been otherwise. The political class became too stiff, deluded that it's simply there\nand no one can take its place. Relying on the attitude that serious people mind their own\nbusiness and don't go into politics. And we see in politics people who\nhaven't achieved much in their career. There are many, many people who don't have a profession and that's why they got into politics. That was the backup career of the little\nlosers of Romania, not the big losers. The big losers are tragic figures, like Dostoievski.\nThese are little losers. What do you think makes you a fit\nfor this seat at Victoria Palace? My colleagues, and the president of the\nparty made statements in this regard. What makes her a fit? Viorica\nDancila is a civilized woman, a non-conflictual woman. She's very communicative. Liviu Dragnea transformed the fostering\nof mediocrity into an ideology. He appointed people without any experience\nin the highest seats in the state. I will do everything I can to\ndevelop the Romanian economy. And began to defy Western values. We joined the EU, very well. But we shouldn't be forced\nto eat all that processed food. Why should we be forced to? Don't we have good enough wheat? And be what? Maybe tenants in our own country,\nand possibly slaves. He antagonised the EU. A narrative emerged that to me,\neven though I was younger during communism It reminded me of things like:\nhow dangerous foreigners are, how dangerous multinationals are, how the EU exploits us. Nationalism will always be a weapon\nyou can use to erase your own political blunders. The more incompetent a regime is,\nthe more probable it is to find an external enemy. In the spring of 2019, with an\nopen case awaiting sentencing and a round of elections approaching, Liviu Dragnea played everything on\na campaign with huge rallies, aggressive speeches and music from the late Ceausism period. What broke out now with Dragnea is not out of the blue. No! Nationalist extremism has been around all along\nin the PSD and in Romanian society. It was just biding its time. Like a disease that waits for certain moment\nof weakness of the immune system. And that's why it broke out. The weakness that Liviu Dragnea exploited was the fear of change in the old generation,\nwho lived a good part of their lives in communism. Any change comes with fear. And it comes with fear especially for seniors. They have a natural fear that\nyou can't criticise them for, and which we're not addressing either They're getting older, so they think:\n\"OK, is there going to be any stability? What about my pension, my everyday life?\" They're no longer active, and can't just\nchange their jobs, or do something else. And when we talk about change we have to be mindful and say to those\nwho aren't very excited about change that there is room for everyone\nand that no one will be left behind. If grandchildren would tell grandparents:\n\"Look, I see your perspective and your fear, but modern Romania means this,\nand if you care about me, then be with me for modern Romania, not against it \" There would be a much stronger\nbond between the generations. Why did you come here? I work for people like you. That I want justice! What justice? That man you support,\ndoes the worst kinds of injustice! How's that? I wouldn't believe that! How could you not believe it? I wouldn't believe it! From here I greet all the children of Moldova, her sons and grandsons, that have taught us for centuries what the homeland means! We all need a homeland! It was a bending of reality. Many interpretations and analyses\nclaim that history doesn't go backwards. Yes, you control the levers of power,\nbut what are you going to do? For how long can you govern against society? Each one of those protests has created even more resistance\nfrom people who see what's going on, you can't lie to them, you\ncan't lie to them anymore. They saw, they reacted! We had\nspontaneous, non-violent protests with each of these rallies. And, after the PSD supporters were evacuated\nfrom the square, because they needed a lift home, those squares have been re-occupied. *Romanian birthday song but with years\nin jail instead of years of happy life* Rallies, anti-European speeches and the\nnationalist brew spilled onto the people proved to be insufficient after all. Romanians rejected this kind of leadership,\nnot just with their protests, but also with their vote. PSD recorded in 2019, at the\nEU Parliament and Presidential elections, the worst results in its history. It's a lesson that goes\nbeyond dislike of a particular party. 30 years after the fall of communism, Romania states that it doesn't accept\nto be ruled with the methods of the past anymore. My child, who voted this year, voted fully aware of who he's voting for,\nresearching, collecting information. He voted differently. And he has very high standards for those he\nvoted for, and I like that a lot. There will be a time, in Romania, of a revolt of a new generation\nwho has different expectations to mine. My parents wanted to have food, right? We had food. Then we wanted to have a car,\na home and holidays abroad. For my children, having a car, a house and trips\nabroad is not an objective, they have them already. They have other goals: contribute to society,\ngain respect, public office, personal career. Last time I was in England, I went with a Romanian Uber driver\nwho was there only because his boy was studying for a political science degree. And he said that the boy\nwas studying political science with a plan to come back\nto Romania and go into politics. And I find that beautiful. Something has changed. Something has changed in Romanian society. There were high expectations in\nRomania, indeed, very high. But if you look back in time, it's impossible not to notice, however,\nthat Romania has transformed dramatically. What, do you want me to be\noptimistic at my age? To allow myself that? What can I say?\nI dare, reluctantly, to hope that, finally, I won't be living\nin the Socialist Republic of Romania anymore. UNIVERSITY SQUARE\nDECEMBER 2019 TO THE HEROES OF THE\nROMANIAN REVOLUTION My parents lived through communism\nand told me some things ... They told me they weren't allowed\nto talk, they had taboo topics, not just in the family,\nbut in general, on the street ... That everything was rationed.\nAnd for us it's very strange now to imagine someone only having\na certain ration of bread or milk or ... It wasn't for nothing ... it changed. It changed the fact that we are free\nto choose what we want to do, which is very important,\nespecially for your career. We have many more opportunities, like\nthis here, for me to present my ideas. Before '89 no one would've\nasked me what my opinion was. I can't imagine how I could be restricted\nfrom talking about what's going on. For us it was like this forever.\nFree, entitled and believing we can\ndo anything we want. But back then it was completely different. There are a few people who say that\nduring communism it was better, but ... No, it's not true."}

Jumătate din chipul său a devenit roșu și a fost internat într-un spital din Suceava. Acolo a luat o bacterie și, din cauza infecției, contururile feței sale au început să se șteargă, ca într-un blestem.\n\nVasile vine dintr-un sat care se numește Marginea. Iar povestea e că el a plecat de la această margine de lume, cu toate cicatricile la vedere, și-a petrecut copilăria și adolescența prin spitale, în căutarea chipului său, dar a găsit și altceva: și-a întâlnit sensul vieții.\n\nVasile a înțeles că este chemat să fie medic, mai exact chirurg plastician.

Medic !\nDoctor ! From the need to help others I feel..somehow, that this is what I'm supposed to do This, since always I haven't even considered another thing,  another profession or.. From first grade on, since the teacher asked us: “What do you want to be when you grow up?“ The first word was “\"doctor“ How many surgeries have you been through? I've lost count... Around 30-40, something like that... Where are you from, Vasile? From Suceava. From a village in Suceava. Marginea is the name of it When I was two years old, I pulled  a pot of hot water from the woodstove the hot water spilled I stayed in the steam for a while, my skin got very irritated, it became red, I went to the hospital in Suceava Flashbacks from the hospital, I do have, but from the moment of the accident, I don't I don't really remember anything, only what my mom told me Being there, committed for two months, for a month it wasn't so bad, so to say After a month he caught an infection And the infection dug and dug I don't know exactly Probably from the hospital conditions or... from a bacteria, I think, it was something... And the infection made it all worse My parents managed it very hard, never knowing how... how it's  done, what happens in a hospital, how things work... And I've asked mister doctor: „Mr doctor, look, this, that... he seems to be getting more...“ Careful not to upset him.. And not to make anyone angry or saying:  „What? You think you know better?“. Or who knows... Finally, if i sign a liability document, that I accept responsibility in case something happens, yes, can I... Take him from the hospital Yes. And if you have... And where did you take him? Did you know where you would go? Yes, this was the question from the doctor as well: „Do you know where...“ „No, Mr. doctor, I will go to Bucharest, Ifill search, do something....“ And the first time Icame, Ifound a hospital The sign said „Burn victims hospital“, but it was of adults. I didn't also read that it was for adults, I looked, I entered, I knocked on the door and they told me: „No, ma'am, because we do t have children's anesthetic, so we cannot receive you “ They gave me an address: „Look, go to Grigore Alexandrescu, that's where children's emergencies and hospital are“ And I went and...With the child in my arms, he was 2 at the time... And did he have this infection as well? Yes, that infection too,, yes. It was acute at the time. Yes... It was festering... Running down his face. It was just leaking,  I mean.. It was leaking and... It was very... And did they receive you at Grigore Alexandrescu? Yes. A despairing lady appeared, with a child in her arms. A child with an extraordinarily severe burn. With half his head carbonized. It's true that the mother was decisive, she believed that they were not giving him the complete treatment and not doing what he needed. She took her child in her arms, as I said, and she came. We were  lucky to meet some special people there and I was told that had I come there in the first place, there would have been no infection. I mean, it wouldn't have come to this, it would have left almost no mark. You always feel sad when you see somebody coming after a period of time knowing that this was our specialty, this is what we do here But there were muscles, bones, skin that were deeply destroyed on which, we tried, little by little, to get to a healthy terrain from where we can cover it. Covering it was a problem, because meanwhile, after managing to cover the burn with new tissue, the boy grew. And he was growing and growing and we had to keep adapting to this growth. Although I could have done more,  what I did, was potentiated by the trust of this remarkable family The most memories I have are from here, the Bucharest hospital Grigore Alexandrescu, starting when I was about 4-5 years old in Intensive Therapy. The door was open, I was seeing, for example, the doctors walking around on the corridors I still remember...I know the place where my mom was sitting. She was more withdrawn, with a little book in her hand. And the pain... I still remem... I still have them... There were a few painful surgeries. He was small, crying on the train, I had no means to transport him. It was just me and him He was crying... From there, we would take the taxi to get to the hospital He had some comfort around the children in the ward, the other children with problems like him, They were encouraging each other ...That it will pass, that it will be ok and... Another one was saying  „It hurts”, another saying  „Me too”. And so on... We were like a family in the hospital. Being there for so long, I knew almost everybody. Including Mr. doctor and the nurse ladies. We used to say that we need to go to the hospital. „Yes, mama, yes! We're going to the hospital! So I will meet Mr. doctor and the nurse ladies!“ Even I was on vacation and I was mostly wasting it in the hospital, it was better that way for me. If he hadn't seen so many accidents and so many poor children,  enduring the same pain as him, I can't imagine... I can't imagine what he might have done. Sitting so much in the hospital and seeing everything the doctors are doing every day, from here, the dream to become a doctor was born. Yes, he wants it very much, he wishes for it very much To be a doctor, to be able to help others, as others have helped him It happened right in the hospital, he said:\n„Mama, I wish so much to become this“. I said: „God willing, Vasilică!“. The ophthalmologist told me that the eye is healthy If it opens, it can be fixed in time, And that is good news... He has a list of preferences. To open his eye, to fix his eyebrow, to shape his face a bit. The surgeries I do now are very small touch-ups, compared to what was in the beginning The left arm was stuck to my body, the fingers stuck together Half my head without hair Missing ear The eye very occluded, the mouth completely tightened... Are you still nervous? How could I help it... I'm waiting for Vasilica to see what... Did you film me? Yes, it is, how do I say it..a special place. I don't know, a different kind of healing, compared to the one in the hospital. There is a certain energy people transmit to each other there. Special. I don't know, you feel very good and that gives you a lot of trust for the future. I mean after the camp you are left with a very happy memory that can help a lot in difficult moments. I was imagining, the moment Isaw his face, I was imagining what pain he had to go through and how much strength it takes to look at yourself in the mirror again when you remove those bandages. Somehow he is grateful to life, to the people he has met ant the people he came into contact with, that helped him And I think that he will, in turn, change a lot of destinies. We allow Vasilica to join us sometimes to see what it's like in a clinical section, a plastic surgery ward And he got our hearts right from the start. He is well behaved, shy, but very curious and determined. We even allowed for him to be in the room during an intervention. I was expecting to get nervous. I mean the first time I would see... I saw some things on the Internet, but now, in reality, I was expecting... for it to be different, and it is different, but it was very good. We have plenty of visitors... High school students thinking of going to                                                "}

They live here in 18 square meters, with problems, with leakage coming from the roof, walls covered in mold. Their income is low. In other words, they are potential beneficiaries of social housing. ROBERTO PĂTRĂȘCOIU IS THE MANAGER OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY ROMANIA AND HIS MAIN OCCUPATION IS WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN NEED OF SOCIAL HOUSING Think of the fact that there are cities where the number of available social housing is 4, 5, 6, and the number of requests is 1000, 2000, 3000. Therefore, with an offer that is null compared to the request, it is hard to say that the state even offers social housing at all, as this is a nonsense, practically speaking. ROBERTO PĂTRĂȘCOIU IS ONE OF THE EU PROTECTS HEROES, A CAMPAIGN THROUGH WHICH THE EU SHEDS LIGHT TO ORDINARY PEOPLE IN SERVICE OF THOSE AROUND THEM ROBERT PĂTRĂȘCOIU: We are speaking of a social housing fund that is below 2% of the total stock of housing. This places us by far the lowest among European countries. We are the country that was left behind the most when it comes to housing. In which 20.5% of the housing stock is in severe degradation, 20%. We're placed the last in the EU at this section. It is estimated that around 3 million people are in need of decent housing, which means that they live in inadequate conditions. WHY DOES ROMANIA HAVE SO FEW SOCIAL HOUSES? From the higher authorities to the lower ones, there is no focus on this. If, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to adequate housing is present, this right is not exercised in Romania. Then, of course, houses need to be built. CUMPĂNA COMMUNE, CONSTANȚA COUNTY HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILT A RESIDENTIAL QUARTER FOR THE LOCALS WITH LOW INCOMES Here we built, in time, 24 houses. And over there in the distance are the first two quadruple houses, the work had been completed and its inhabitants moved in. 16 families live there. We can go inside, so you would see what's it all about. Childrean learn better in school. The moment they have a decent, clean, functional house, their grades improve. It's too much to say you are changing the world, but here indeed, a world is changing. Maya's world is changing, Oana's world is changing, a few other worlds are changing. WHAT IS THE STATE OF SOCIAL HOUSING IN THE REST OF EUROPE? In countries like the Netherlands, the social housing fund is at 30%. 30%, in the Netherlands! These people solved their issue with social housing. Finland has one of the best developed social housing systems in the world, and its principle is very simple: First give the man a house, without imposing any other conditions. 80% of the homeless or people in dire need of housing that received a house hold on to that house and pay installments, eventually. Because this man, the moment he has a decent house, can wash himself so he can go to work and get paid. This man can now get a job, think of education and have his self esteem back. Finland, being the only country in the EU, in which the phenomenon of lack of shelter, of homelessness is on the decline. BERCENI COMMUNE, PRAHOVA COUNTY And there, in the distance, you can spot the red helmets from here, these are volunteers from Habitat for Humanity. Welcome! Come see what we're up to here, it's really fun here! And we've been able to get a lot done, which makes us feel good too. Yeah, absolutely. I see the foundation, and the second foundation also. These people that you see here on the site are volunteers, people that took from their own free time. They've traveled here from the US to leave behind built houses. We want to build 20 houses for 20 families in the long run, so we will have here a community of 100 members. Hey, Ron! How are you? I'm doing great, how are you? This people donate for us,  as they come here with financial resources as well. The donation from each is not considerable, but it comes from many volunteers, as we host annually over 2000 volunteers, so there are a lot of donations from which we can build these houses. This is beautiful! Yeah. I noticed that all of you are really happy here. We are, yes! We only work 5 days a week, so this is new to us, it's fun. Have you met the family for which you are building the house? Yes, it was wonderful! To the lady who had a baby and is moving here, we said we are blessed to work with you and she started crying: \"I am so blessed that you are coming!\" We were touched. We all cried. And we had quite a hard time... Have a look at this wall here, all of it was covered in mold. So all three of us sleep over there. The girl and I on the bed and my husband on the armchair that expands into a single bed. My husband, having asthma and silicosis, the moment it starts to get warm, he sleeps in a bed outside. It is very hard for us... SANDU FAMILY WILL SETTLE DOWN IN ONE OF THE HOUSES THAT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IS BUILDING NOW IN BERCENI Watch your head. A living room will be here. This over here will be a bathroom. And to the left and right, bedrooms. The families give back part of the total cost of the house. Let's say we are building the house with approximately 50.000 euros, the real cost. We sell this house to the families for approx. 17.000, 18.000 euros with no interest or profit, on a duration of 20 years. And at all times adapted to what the family can pay. We're talking of rates of 300-350 RON a month, rates that we invest in a rotating fund, from which other houses are built. SINCE ITS INAUGURATION IN 1996, HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILT FROM SCRATCH AND RECONSTRUCTED OVER 5.000 HOUSES I truly enjoy contributing for and helping those who are vulnerable. I think that a society that is fulfilled is one that learned throughout its history, that it can only develop uniformly once its members realize they have to take care of each other and that together, they have to help those less fortunate. Our problems do not end here. In fact, perhaps they only start there. Because we live in a system, we live in a society, and if we want to live in the society we strive for, I think we have to start with ourselves.

I would like to report a possible illegal logging. Bucovina People of the forest What is your right to record me? We are on a road that leads to a property of the Romanian state. Please turn off the camera! Wait... I'm asking you nicely! Don’t record, why... We need to steal so we can get back the bribe money we paid to the state. THE NETWORK OF WOODEN THIEVES I kept stealing and I didn't get anywhere. And I don't want to steal anymore. Don’t you ask me questions, everything is alright. THE STATE IS PASSIVE I have faith that in a few years you will go there and you will see an impressive beautiful forest. DESTROYED FORESTS Didn't you cut down anything here? My lord... How to cut down...? What to cut down? These are biased accusations! Hei!? Do not use this securist talk with me (i.e. Communist Secret Service approach), please! I mean, don’t fool me, so.... I did my military service at the Securitate ( i.e. Communist Secret Service) and I can deal with you. I can handle it, you’re a bit disobedient, I told you... Enough! Record! Why did you hit me? Why are you recording my woods? I am on a public road! The wood is mine! You can be on the road... Why did you hit me? Why did you hit me with the car? I want to know why? I am on a public road, I am allowed to record! Yes? OK! ON THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE WOODEN THIEVES Since the Revolution (1989) and up to now over five million trucks with wood have been stolen from the country's forests. A column of trucks could surround the borders of Romania 26 times. In recent years, law changes and the creation of mobile apps such as „The Inspector of the Forests” have left the impression that illegal logging activity is decreasing. Theoretically, the Romanian state keeps track of each timber transport that takes place on the territory of Romania. Moreover, each citizen can check in real-time on their phone whether a truck he comes across does or doesn't have the documents for the transported wood. However, with these newly created mechanisms, the wood thieves have also modernized their methods. Therefore, wood theft continues at full speed. According to the Recorder data, over 12 million cubic meters of wood disappear illegally from Romanian forests every year. It means that for every 2 trees cut legally, someone else cuts one illegally. Hei! Can you please show me your documents? Would you mind… Yes, I would mind! Sorry?! Let me do my job! I let you do your job but show me your documents. Bring a control authority, from ITRSV (i.e. Ministry of Waters and Forests), and I will tell you… From which parcel do you have the wood? But who are you? Are you from the control authority? Who are you? We are journalists. You are, but how do you walk alone through the forest like that? I am a journalist and I want to know where was this wood was cut down from! From the state forest? You will know, but not now… The situation is severe because by refining their methods, the thieves have reached an ideal position: they can steal quietly, under the guise of legality. Recorder will show you how Romania's forests are being destroyed, while we believe the situation is under control. In August, when we went on the ground, a kind of prohibition was instituted in the forests of Romania. In such a period, healthy and large trees can only be cut in completely exceptional situations. Only cuttings for the care of the forests are allowed, meaning broken trees, ripped from the roots, dried or sick. This wood is sold to companies that deal with wood processing. Its extraction is done according to strict rules. First, the forest authority draws up an inventory document. Then on the field, the trees from the document are marked, by using a special hammer that has at the end a stamp with a unique identification number. Thus, the owner of a company that has tendered for the right to cut from the forest, is in the hands of foresters who must first mark each tree to be cut. Theoretically, foresters should only mark the affected trees and should do so before organizing the auction. In reality, they mark only part of the dry trees and wait to see who wins the auction. Then, after the foresters and the business men come to the agreement, the rest of the trees are marked, but among the healthy ones, which are more valuable on the wood market. A real crime! Because instead of remaining a healthy forest, cleansed of compromised trees, you get a forest full of dry treas. Among the thieves, this is called the \"Addition Method\" and was described to us both by the foresters in the system, as well as by the business men who practice it. They should mark what is damaged, what is crushed by a tractor, what is broken, the tips that are broken, so all that ... all the damaged ones. But when they mark the first time, they only mark one here, one there... Then they mark the most beautiful ones. Instead of marking all the dry trees up, right? Yes, they should first mark the dried trees. But they mark what is good… This way the businessman is satisfied, pays, and is able to continue the work. At the end of August, I went to Moldovița commune, Suceava county. Here are the forests of Bucovina older than 100 years and our sources have informed us that there are illegal deforestations in the area. On a Saturday afternoon on a forest road we came across Vasile Florescu, the owner of Turculeț SRL. He had just finished loading 35 squared meters of perfectly healthy, green wood, in a place where only the cutting of dry, sick, or damaged trees, so-called \"accidentals\", are allowed. Don’t you ask me questions, everything is alright. Everything is alright? But I see that you should have \"accidentals\" here. I see good wood here! “Accidentals” are also good wood. Look, this wood is white, what is wrong with it? What is wrong with this wood? I have… I bought the wood. Yes? Yes! But tell me, there, what is wrong with those tree trunks? Those should be dry woods! Look! It's white like milk foam! Is it marked? Yes, it is marked! Yes? Please show me where is it marked! Show me on the trunk, above one meter, where is it marked? Where is the mark? Be careful! Run… Aren't you showing me where is the mark? It is marked, I have no time now to show you… Two, four… Look, what a disaster! What a disaster they have left! Look down there! Look here! Is it really possible? We went to the forest with Gheorghe Oblezniuc, a former forestry worker who, in the past, was also accused of illegal logging. He knows all the methods practiced by the wood thieves. Now, he is in conflict with the wood mafia from this area and he shows us some recently cut trees. All evidence shows that it was operated by the ”Addition” method. This should be cut down. This was on the paper. Rotten, look, with a hole, fallen, broken. See? And look at what they took! They cut perfectly healthy trees, freshly marked by them, look, so! And what they took! This has about 3 square meters of wood. This type of tree values 12 million (approx. 250 Euros). This one was on the papers. That's what you find in the papers, not this one. That's what you find, the size of the tree. But this one you can't find. A few steps further down the valley we find other clumps that indicate the cutting of healthy trees. The cutting is recent. Look, healthy! Look at how the tree is crying! It dries, resin comes out, it cries that it has been cut! There was nothing wrong with it! Healthy, white, healthy! Look at how it is crying! I'm still looking for the mark...but no ... I don't see any mark. At least no mark on this one. Considering the green remains we found in the forest, and the truck full of healthy wood freshly cut, we considered that we have all the reasons to alert the authorities. But the discussion went differently than we would have expected. Good evening, I would like to report possible illegal logging. It is in Moldovița, they are logging from the forest road called \"Dubul\". I will check right away and I will let you know! Ok. One moment... It has approval. So, it has approval, it is registered in the database… Wait, it doesn’t… It doesn’t have marks at all on the trees. He had to have marks on them! It had to have marks on them! I will redirect you to the police if you want. Yes, please! From what they told me from STS (112) where you called, they checked the transport and it is registered. The transport may be registered, but I tell you that the transported wood may come from illegal logging, because it does not have any forest mark. Have you been there and checked? Yes, yes, I went and checked with my eyes, I didn't see any mark, that's why I say it's a suspicious transport. Ok, my lord! Pardon?! We will check. If not confirmed, you will bear the consequences. What do you mean? Since you were told it's a transport… I understood that it has approval… ...registered and legal. But there are two distinct things: having transport approvals and… Ok, goodbye! So here it is how the Romanian citizens are intimidated to call 112, if they have suspicions that a wood transport could be illegal. The national system for verifying the legality of wood transport proves its limits here. Because thefts are done by such subtle methods, the simple citizen can do nothing. When calling 112 the citizen is ensured that everything is legal. However, the question remains: how was it possible for the transport of Vasile Florescu, the owner of Turculeț SRL, to be included in documents as legal, while the evidence suggests that he had cut down trees that he was not allowed to cut? Here's how it is possible: Vasile Florescu had the right to cut trees from that forest, because he had won a tender for the \"accidental\" damage: dry or damaged trees. In fact, he cut down healthy trees that he recorded in the transport deeds on behalf of the dry ones. This is how the \"addition\" method works. He could not do this illegality without the complicity of the forest patrols who manage the forest and who marked healthy trees instead of the dry ones. The correct marking is done long before cutting and it is applied in two places: at the base of the tree and at 130 cm high. In the “addition” method, the forest man marks healthy trees only at the base and covers the sign with soil. The trunk is left unmarked not to get attention. Lastly, the owner of the companies that steal healthy wood, cut down the marked trees and load them into trucks. There is no mark on the trunks, and if any possible control notices this fact, the answer is that they were erased during loading. Why isn’t there any mark on the trees? Yes, they have! But it fades when… Does the mark fade? How come? Of course, it scratches! Why? Why… I didn't even see a single mark! Do all of them scratch? It is! Where? I can’t see it! The next day I went to the Suceava forest guard to present the case discovered in Molodvița. The Forest Guard represents the control authority of the forest patrols who administrate the forests. I choose an on-site check. We returned to Moldovița together with two inspectors from the Forest Guard. They gathered the forest man of the area and the patron that appears in the Recorder footage. Vasile Florescu warns us not to make again the mistake of inspecting the wood from the suspect trucks. I asked you two simple things: if you have approval ... But this is how you always like to get involved. And if I drop a piece of wood on you? Why would you drop it? Maybe I would have dropped it! It happens! Are you threatening me or what? Why do you continue recording… Please don’t threaten me! I'm not threatening you! But what if… It's not good to get under the wood. In the forest inspectors find clues that lead to the “addition” method: clumps of healthy trees recently marked. The forest man seems to have no answers. What is with… ...the mark? It is marked. It is marked, but we verified and… It is marked… But it was given…. What was given? Look, there are numbers. Did you take photos to look at it? In the meantime, the forest man seems to have found a reason to approve the cutting of a healthy tree. What was wrong with this tree? Look here! Either it was drying, or it was pecked by woodpeckers, or ... By woodpeckers?! Yes, yes, it's dry at the top. We saw some healthy tree trunks there. That’s it, it’s… Bring a chainsaw to collect samples and send them for analysis. The inspection team collects the incriminating evidence, puts them in a charcoal bag for barbecue and seals them with scotch. They are handed over to a policeman who has the mission to send them to a forensic laboratory. What will happen with the evidence now? It stays with the police, in my custody ... The investigation does not seem to scare Vasile Florescu. In a recording made by a local, he is convinced that the investigation will stop, and the agreement between him and the forest man will continue. I give it (i.e. bribe) to receive wood! The wood comes marked everything, so they can kiss me somewhere! They will be held accountable (foresters), not me! They collect the samples, seal them nicely. Directly to Bucharest. Listen... They supervise all the expertise that is done at Bucharest… The authority doesn't dare to inspect, they know it is trouble! They don’t dare! They are not allowed! The conclusion: they do not dare! It's not allowed! It was said by a business owner investigated for wood theft. It introduces us to the true dimension of the story. This is not just about the complicity between an owner and a forest man, but a pyramid system in which the thief is known and covered to the highest level of the state. We start from the bottom of the pyramid. In the forest guarded by the forest man you saw shrugging, it is not possible to mark illegally without the approval of the superior, namely the authority chief, the one who keeps the hammer with the forest marks under the key. He has that key, I have this key. So, theoretically, no hammer could leave here without your awareness. No. And without the awareness of the man, of the one to whom I gave the hammer. Georgel Zlei is the head of the Moldovița forest, one of the richest forests in the Bucovina. He was annoyed that we alerted the forest guard instead of pointing out the forest irregularities to him. We knew each other, why didn’t you come here in the first place? To go together… Why? I think it's better here, in my house... I mean, I can give you the best ... ...information about what is happening and with what ... Or at least I should… Two weeks prior to this discussion, we had done exactly what he told us to do. We had announced that I had found an area where there was evidence of stolen wood by using the” addition” method. We brought him right to the spot. Look! There were downfalls caused by wind or snow: natural destabilizing factors. Here is the cause... Yes, this is the cause: the wind and the snow. And not the human? Human is everywhere! Not only here… From our information, provided from people within \"the system\", we found out that in this forest are marked healthy trees as well, because they have a higher value on the market compared to the injured ones. How do you respond to this accusation? Those are tendentious accusations. Unproven. Those are bad intentions Georgel Zlei's past is full of serious accusations regarding the theft of wood in the forests he administered. Many of them have been documented in the central press. Exactly the same theft methods are mentioned. In 2001 Gerogel Zlei was dismissed from his position of forest chief in \"Tomnatic\", near Moldovița, due to hundreds of stolen trees from the forest he had to protect. Nothing happened to him, moreover, he was promoted. Four years later, he was appointed the chief of Cârlibaba forest, a much richer forest. Illegal deforestation became a problem here as well. This time, a record: 50.000 cubic meters of wood, the equivalent of about 30.000 trees. He left this position as well, and later he was appointed the chief of Moldovița forest, which he has been managing for over a decade. Look: \"Suceava’s forests, destroyed by the forest men.\". The article is mentioning you. Yes, but show me someone who didn’t destroy any… Didn't you cut anything here? My lord... ...how to cut? What to cut? I am not appointed in this position to destroy the forest, I am here to grow it! You know how the press… How? The story must be spectacular for the audience... ...they exaggerate the stories. Georgel Zlei has always landed on his feet after all the investigations in which he was involved. Those who know how the forest system works in Suceava say that the explanation is in his political connections. Zlei is a member of the PNL (i.e. National Liberal Party) and was high school and university colleague with Gheorghe Flutur, the president of the Suceava county council and PNL first vice-president. A witness under the protection of anonymity, a former forest inspector, told us about the methods of theft in the forests administered by Zlei. So, there were illegal deforestations. Deforestations without APV approvals. They cut more than it was mentioned in the approvals. A bigger volume… In the approvals, the trees were thinned, but in reality, they were much thicker. Yes. And then you could illegally get wood out of the forest. It depends on how much you wanted to earn, how big the demand was. These methods, with a legal appearance, are generalized in Bucovina and practiced even by the companies of some local politicians. The mayor of Moldovița has a company in the name of his wife and son. Last year, the company was the subject of a criminal file: wood theft of some extra 500 cubic meters, compared to the approval. We found the mayor of Traian Ilie in a state of irritation after a hard day of work. Yes, what should I tell you, so you know, I was, I had… ...I drank 50 grams of cognac, I don’t “stink like alcohol”. I drank only 50 grams…. Yes? Yes! Mr. mayor... How could your company make illegal deforestations from the state forest? But where did you find it was illegal deforestation? There is a criminal case investigation at the moment. Yes...the case is ... ...it is investigated and those who did it to you, they have criminal records... The forest guard… I'm done, so the end will tell. I know this: in court, there is a final and irrevocable decision. That's what you should consider, not what the guard said. Is there anything else that you would like to ask me? You’re a bit disobedient just so you know, a bit disobedient… Just like that, you upset me. We didn’t interrupt the interview just so you know. No, don’t come and say, you know, I want, this, you know…. These are legitimate questions I asked you. Aren't these legitimate questions? Speak nice, not that X or Y informed you, that the mayor, that... .... to his company cut it, that ... these will be solved, at the end ... in the end it will be solved. It's a criminal case on... No, no problem, we will solve the criminal case. We'll see who's to blame. Yes? Yes! Fake documents, stolen wood! That's certain! Tiberiu Boșutar runs a small civic association in Moldovița. Its purpose is to save the forests in the area and Tiberiu has found an ingenious solution to prove the massive thefts. He installed at the window of his apartment several surveillance cameras. For 3 years I had my eyes stuck on the cameras, analyzing them 24/7 and I try to identify absolutely all the transports of wood that leave and enter the locality. In the beginning the situation was terrible. Because, during the first months, more than 100 transports of resinous wood were leaving the town, without any approval. From 2016 until today, he has managed to monitor over 8000 transports and he registered them in tables. Among them were the transports made by the Moldovița mayor's firm. The City Hall immediately took action. I had complaints, a criminal complaint from the city hall to the police and I was criminally investigated for installing video equipment. I don't know, they accused me of ... they know what I am recording. Yes...this... that association had to come to the town hall and say: ”Hei, I want to set up surveillance cameras” People can’t set up cameras as they please and where they please. But what's the problem? Why is this camera bothering? No, don’t approach me with these..you know. We discussed, I told you. This seems fair to me! Not like “Why is this camera bothering?”. The City Hall failed to force the Tiberiu to take down the cameras so that today we have a live image on the illegal transportation of wood from Moldovița. First, we notice a truck with two trailers making the first transport. Then we see the same truck as the second transport. Although the evidence can be verified in the online database by anyone, there is only one transport. He took 71, 70, unloaded them home and from the yard, he loaded these woods and uses the same approval. And look again why it seems suspect: here are some branches... if we take the approval, and compare the pieces and with the approval, we would discover that the approval doesn’t correspond with the transport. So here he has some wood for the fire, he has about 10 cubic meters of wood for fire. But look, there’s the owner in front of him, in front of the truck. Do we have clear evidence that there are multiple shipments with the same approval? Sure! The Romanian state never wanted to apply the simple solution of Tiberiu, although it does so successfully in the case of car certificates. Nowadays surveillance cameras automatically detect car plate numbers, and automatic systems send fines to those who drive without rights on public roads. They say they don't have a legal framework. But it's silly because there are so many crimes that are discovered by surveillance cameras on the street. The police asked me 50 times for these cameras, and they identified crimes, they identified criminals, so the camera proofs were valid in those cases. Ironically, for illegal logging, the camera proofs are no longer valid. The passivity of the authorities is already commonplace in Moldovița. We went back to the forest with the forest chief to show him new evidence of illegal deforestations in the forests he claims he knows by heart. This time he is no longer so sure that there are no illegal deforestations in the areas he administrates. Is it possible here to cut down the threes illegally, next to the road, and you don't know about it? It is possible… But it is next to the main road. So what? There is 70 km of road in the forest, I cannot… This is the road near the barrier. That is why I am a forest man, that is why there is a different chief, that is why there are others. I can't check it myself ... I need to know all this. How can someone take out such a large amount of wood near the road and none of your employees be aware of it? We'll see, I can't answer this ... because no ... I don’t have an answer now. Pressured by the questions, Georgel Zlei sits on a log and he suddenly gets a tooth pain, and he can’t talk any longer. What? First of all, I am not… Aren’t you able to talk? No, I can’t, I have a tooth pain… Arriving back at the forest authority office, Georgel Zlei informs us that he has received a phone call from Bucharest and that we cannot enter the forest without prior approval from the center. We have a letter from the director: in order to film in the forest, you will have to ... ... administered by the director, you will have to get approval from the national forest management. It's convenient to stop the press from going into the forest and to see the irregularities, right? While forest men are hiding behind the tooth pains or the overnight orders, some businessmen bidding on the timber market are starting to talk about the vicious circle of bribes that supports illegal logging. How do the forest men of the state encourage the theft of wood from the state forest? They force us. How do they force you? Do they force you to steal? Take stolen wood? Yes, illegal wood. We (i.e. economic agents) must steal so we can get back the bribes we paid to the state. The money we gave them. And how much is the bribe? How much do you pay? It depends on the deal per cubic meter. 150-200 RON (30-40 Euros) per cubic meter. There are 200 RON (40 Euros) in addition to the money you officially pay. You pay it once to the state. And the second time you give them money to get you better wood, so you can deal with the one you do not have at the place of exploitation. Can you go back now? Can you get out of the bribing system of forest men? Yes, but you must go bankrupt. You must close the company, otherwise, you have no chance to survive. You go bankrupt because the bribe system has raised the price of wood. At the auctions organized by the forest departments, the companies end up offering an exorbitant price for the quantity of wood. This is because besides the official wood, often of poor quality, the foresters negotiate in secret with the owners wood on the black market. Why is the price so high at auctions? Those from the forest authority instigate: “I will prepare it for you, I will mark for you only the best trees, so you can make your job.\" You can do whatever you want. Thus, the business can be profitable only in one way: only when each wood purchase legally is accompanied by another one bought illegally, at half price. Tiberiu Boșutar did an experiment in which he tried to follow only the legal path. I purchased 100 m cubes of good wood. Out of those 100 cubic meters, 55 m cubic lumber was sold, which we sold on average below 700 RON (150 Euros), and from the aftermath, we did not make a profit for another 100 m cubic wood, without considering the employees, power, maintenance ... So, I closed the first hundred. Because you cannot legally work in Moldovița in these conditions. We could work if besides those 100 cubic meters of wood that I bought for approx 400 RON (85 Euros), we bought 100 m cubes of illegal wood for 200 RON (43 Euros). Two years ago, when he founded the Moldovița Association, Tiberiu Boșutar gathered all the business owners in the area at a table. He explained that the only solution is to get everyone out of this vicious circle. I went to everyone: \"Good people, in my opinion, the direction is not good. Let's identify other direction! One can live dignified and beautiful without stealing. By stealing wood, we do not live well because we expose ourselves, we are vulnerable to the authorities. We kept stealing and I got nowhere. And I don't want to steal anymore. From such a volume of wood, you can live worthy without stealing! You cannot take a branch from the forest without the forest man noticing. This theft ... I deduced that this theft is supported, controlled and encouraged directly by the forest authorities \" His plea was unsuccessful. The owners were not willing to abandon the corrupt loop circuit, they continued to buy illegal wood and began to behave like a real mafia. Whenever an outsider goes into the forest, each of his steps is monitored. This is the fifth time he’s checking on us, just to find out what we’re doing in the forest. He is one of the businessmen operating in the area. The other day the intimidation was even more direct. A car hit us on purpose. Record! Record! Why did you hit me? Why are you recording my wood? Why? I am on a public road! These are mine! You can be on the road... Why did you hit me with the car? I want to know why! I am on a public road, I am allowed to record! Yes? Yes! Yes, I'm a journalist! What is your name? We had to find out that the man who did hit us with the car a few minutes after filming his wood depot is called Simion Chiruț. He is not only the owner of a woodworking company, but also a local councilor from PNL at the Frumosu city hall, a commune near Moldovița. There are illegal deforestations going on as well, and those trying to alert authorities are threatened and even assaulted. The boss came with his people directly to the fight! He said we were terrorizing Suceava ... we are terrorizing Suceava with the controls with notifications all the time, we took pictures in the forests. Which is why ... beating straight, with the pole on the head! The brothers Dumitru and Ilie Bucșă were beaten in the woods after they claimed that illegal deforestation was polluting a river in the area. I like justice..but don’t call the people and come to fight… The businessman who appears in the images is Ilie Negură and owns one of the largest operating companies in the area. We tried to get a point of view regarding the accusations of Bucșă brothers. What is your right to record me? We are on a road that leads to a property of the Romanian state. We have the approval of the forest man to be on this road. It is your business, not mine. Do you need written approval? Pretty please! Don't record! Please! Hei, pretty please! Wait... Hei, pretty pretty please! The repeated notifications of the Bucșă brothers did not impress the local authorities, but they reached the environmental activists in Bucharest. The environmental organization Greenpeace has called on a judicial forestry expert. Greenpeace came to Vama village and prepared a report which shows that the area has been cut twice as much forest as it appears in documents. The report identifies three areas of illegal deforestation. Greenpeace called the authorities and the press on the spot. Gheorghe Mihăilescu is the director of Romsilva, the institution that manages all the forests of the country. He came to Vama with a large delegation. But they went elsewhere, not in the areas indicated in the Greenpeace report. That's why I came here ... But why do you insist on inspecting only the places you want? But this is the place of the agreement. We are hundreds of people and we say it is somewhere else! It was the agreement, I go here, come back ... Did you prepare the ground here, did you paint the trees, as during Ceausescu's time?! And you go to check one place. Why don't you come where people complain? Show me where the fresh paint is! After visiting what he decided to, the Romsilva director told the press that everything is fine. It is a beautiful natural regeneration that replaces, from ... will replace the 140-year-old forest. It is only part of that area covered by these regeneration works. I have the faith that, in a few years, you will go there and you will see an impressive beautiful forest. At the press conference, Gheorghe Mihăilescu was asked to inspect the areas in which Greenpeace reported illegal logging, but said he had other priorities. Yes, I agree to discuss all those, but just like you, I have another program. I have to be in Mărășești tonight to commemorate the Mărășești battle. And I cannot go now to run through all Suceava with you all, because this is not correct. I think it is important to specify what connection does Romsilva has with the battle from Marașești, when today we must check the forests? I am a man who represents ... I also have national representation. Beyond that, I am a patriotic man. For me, that battle meant a lot. Gheorghe Mihăilescu has been running Romsilva since 2018 and was politically appointed. He is the executive president of PSD Vâlcea (i.e. Social Democrat Party) and for 6 years he has overseen the forests in this county. But the political color does not matter in the wood business. The PSD member Gheorghe Mihăilescu came in a facade control on the territory of a county in which the forests are controlled by PNL. Gelu Puiu, the forest chief from Vama, the place where the control was made, is a member of PNL Suceava. The forest authority from Moldovița is also led by a member of PNL. Most of the mayors own on the behalf of their relatives logging businesses. In the middle, there is Gheorghe Flutur, leader of PNL Suceava and former head of the forestry directive in Suceava, where he started his political career. It's not a novelty. In all the counties with large forest areas, the foresters have enjoyed rapid ascents in politics. Their influence did not lead to the protection of forests, but, according to the forest men from the system, to the flourishing of businesses that pumped money in the parties and their members. The money here doesn't go to the people in the village. The money from here, the money from something like this goes to... ... starting from what oversees the authority, direction and so on up to the Parliament, to the election campaigns, to all this crap. TWO WEEKS AFTER THE ROMSILVA CONTROL The economic agents and the authorities in the area were relieved because nothing happened at Vama. Mihăilescu came, did not put anyone in charge, went back as he came. Everyone applauds. The message is that: to remain calm, to steal, because no one will suffer. Was it rather a message of encouragement for thieves? Absolutely! \"Don’t worry, we control everything, nothing will happen.\" So that's how it works ... Mihăilescu wanted to communicate that the situation is under control, that nobody can do anything to them."}

Kiss you too! Have a good day! I'm born on 16th Octomber 1952, I am 67 years old. I've been working since I was 18 I worked at Republic Industrial Plant, I was a member of a team of Mechanical Fitters Electrical wiring, welding, I've done my part, I think please have a seat oh it's your stop I'm really glad I lived to this period, I'm really happy   You see, to this day there are retirees saying \"Man, my pension is small\" But you have two hands, two feet, private companies wait for you Almost 10.000 pensioneers have been employed legally in the last year Workforce crysis forces companies to recruit old people Romania's labour market registers a 500.000 employee deficit Young lady, the leg, please... thank you very much My job is to observe clients, make sure they don't disturb each other to stop alcoholic drinks in the premises       At this moment we have 38 colleagues that work in McDonald's restaurants and are retirees They are very apreciated both by the managers and the younger generation colleagues and when they see we have in our team not only people of their age but their parent's or grandparent's age they are surprised so... the man with white hair has a different education, right? just like in a household please, let me help you Look, I have accumulated 48-49 years of work. I live decently, but I work \"You sit all day with the TV remote control in your hand all day?..when McDonald's need workforce! It's a crisis It's the country's crisis for people Please, come through. Thank you You're welcome Please come back again soon They charged me two of these, instead of... Two for one? Yeah, she charged me twice for That's all! Why you take that out the bag? So you can see them! Come on, my boy, be serious. We are facing a real issue of workforce At this time we have pensioneers -we don't know exactly the number- But employees over the age of 65 -age of retirement- are in a proportion of 7% of the total employees (Tell me a name, please.) We go personally, we have special campaigns of recruitment dedicated to people at the end of their career because they're not afraid to dirty their hands they are trustworthy, they are active and good colleagues overall. And that's why there are only positive aspects of employing someone who's older. I've stayed home for 2 years, time in which I felt I couldn't adjust to the thought of \"I have 5 days, 10 days until\"... I don't know how to put it. \"I'm waiting for my death\", right? There's no joy to you after pension afterall. And I've decided to send out some CVs to different employers. I was manager assistant for 20 years and I've acctepted - eventhough I've been an Assistance Manager I accepted to work at the cash register for 1 year and 2 months. There you go. You're welcome Here at Customer's Service we need to know how to guide customers to different aisles, guide them where they can go to solve their issues, we do returns when there's been made a mistake\" I'd rather stay here. Even if sometimes it's hard, harder even when we get to deal with different clients Some of them well-educated, some less educated, that's the truth, but I'm still in power regardless my age. I come because I want to, I come because I like it I come even for that money that I get from here, it still helps. I've went on a vacation in Thailand, I can go on vacations. Yes, the money I get from here, they help me see the world, see what I've never seen.\" I spoil myself, so of speak The total number of pensioneers that work with a Work Contract reached 158.000 and it's still on the rise. The employers find it more difficult to find youngsters willing to work In the past 10 years, over 3 million Romanians fit for duty went abroad. I've been told numerous times to let -them- work, to go home 'cause I'm old and I should let them work, the young people to come and work and I said: They should come! When a young person will want to replace me, I'll be gone! I want to see him/her! If I follow what I hear at TV, I could say that they aren't offered what they want, a big salary There's room, of course, for raises on paychecks And we say this openly, but it has to come with a reduced fiscality on work We are always talking about this -productivity- Which is not based only on the wage itself relative to how much the man is working. It is also about how much it costs you, the employer, to operate. And if you don't have roads, the logistics are also very expensive, because, yeah, you don't have routes. You don't have highways, there's no railway system that will allow you to... And over all of that, the workforce is unqualified, so you qualify it, you also invest there. All of these raises your global cost. Of course you don't like this Sure, you would rather invest in raises of the salary if all of those other costs would be covered. Reporter: How long have you been working? It's hard for you even to count them... so, yeah. There were 3 shifts back then, in the communist era. Yeah, three shifts. In this furniture workshop in Bucharest the average of age is 55 years. Two of the employees are pensioneers, other two just recieved the decision of retirement. We reach a point where we just don't work... We had young people of 30 and 35 years that came here without any experience with absolutely no skill, and I offered them: \"There's no strains, no schedule. Just stay and learn to do this kind of job.\" He said: \"I don't see myself doing this in 10 years\" And he gave up \"Okay, so what do you want to do?\" He said: \"I don't know\" On the otherhand, we have people well over 55, 50-60 People with early retirement pension that realized they can't just stay at home The pension is not enough for them to survive on. I have a man in my office, he's 70 and he learns to use the computer and he does my primary accounting. At 70 years! However he can, sometimes he forgets, but he does it for me! In the year 2000 I've went to a school for computers I don't know why I didn't do it earlier, it would've been better. But that's how I learned to work on it, that's how I learned Office suite and this and that If you try to learn from one another, it's hard. It's not good to stay too much on the couch, It's not good for your health after X age So you were used to working and -this thing I've noticed in Germany- They go on with their work as long as they can Because, afterall, all this work keeps you in shape After you retire and suddenly you stop working because you think \"from tomorrow, I'll just bum around\" your health will start deteriorating We work until we can't move the next day What can we do? You have no option. When you have a pension worth nothing, what would you do? When you can still move around, you can still work. I'm working still I have time. 45 years of work, this is my 46th year. Enough for me! We are thinking all the time what will we do when all these people that are working for us will get to an age of 65, 66, 67... We're asking for too much, we want too much. And that's our fault as employers. We're living with this desire of paying less to raise the profit margin. That's not how... The profit margin shouldn't come from that source. The profit margin you get from business, from the product you make, that's where it should come from. Your creativeness, where you're unique with your product. Romanians must understand that there cannot be high salaries without any work and the entrepreneurs or the empolyers must understand that they have to pay. The average of active life of population is on the rise in the European Union. In the year 2017, in Germany, the average of active life of population was 38,4 years compared to 34,3 years in the year 2000. According to worst-case-scenario, the deficit of people fit-for-work in Romania could rise from 548.000 people (estimated in 2019) to 910.000 people in 2023."}

This was happening in 2006, when I joined the Ministry of Agriculture, 2005-2006 In a way, if you didn't take something, it was like you had a problem with that person. It was something normal like \"What's wrong with you? It's a lamb!\" \"Wait a second, man, I don't want it!\" Boss, you have a problem with me? \"No please! You want to send a inspection? Please! Please! Tell me! \"Sir, I got nothing against you... I just don't want the lamb...\" It's obvious. He wants to f**k us over. What did I do? Please tell. This is the reality... At the moment, Biaciu is a head of service in the Ministry of Development and he feels all the negative image public officials currently have in our society. This is what I'm talking about! I'm ashamed to tell people I'm a public official. Everyone perceives me as corrupt \"Ah, just another bum, sits and sleeps all day, he does nothing. Browses Facebook on my money! Now he decided to come forth and talk about how the system works. I don't want to be part of this scheme, this gangrene anymore Matei (his son) will ask me \"but what did you do?\" What will I tell him? \"well I wrote, my son, to DNA (National Anticorruption Directorate) but they were sleeping all day I went to Recorded and they filmed me, so they'll hunt me down easier I'm not afraid! That's why I want to leave! Because I'm ashamed of this! About the implementation of projects financed with European money Right now, I work at the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration Between 2007 and 2013 important amounts of money were spent so you, the citizens, to have an easier time when you go to the window of a Public Institution with better and more qualitative, faster services which will make your lifestyle easier. But, briefly, all the money we gave out towards various projects, I can tell you, sincerely, that things don't work. I mean we spend money - 13 million euroes on computer systems for the Pension Fund on computer systems at the Ministry of Education that also don't work We get all the time recommandations from the Commision but also from the structure that manages ... audit sector of the Court of Accounts and they keep telling us \"Come on people, lets get some inspections done\" \"at those projects which we funded with European money\" \"and those which involved investitions in IT\" \"afterall, we don't care anything more than if they work or if they don't.\" \"If they don't work, lets fix them somehow because there were money spent on them\" They weren't able to this day to do an inspection And what do you think they will say? \"Good, come on, Viorica is coming, we will get along\" \"don't mess with justice laws, okay?! \"yes of course\" \"good, ok\" They will shut up for a while and then what will they say? \"Dude, we gave you a few million euroes...\" \"and those people scream at you on different websites and those from Recorder\" with Madalin Iscru and you do this kinda s***t? What do you think they will say once time comes? About political strings-pulling and public officials getting paid without coming to work The briefing mr. Orlando made where he said that there's a ratio of 3 to 1 meaning that one is working and other three are looking at eachother isn't far from reality There might be even more that are doing nothing There are people that are getting paid without coming to work, people that are incompetent and are still getting paid even though they don't deserve it The things right now, are actually... in a moment of gangrene, that's why I want to leave. I don't believe there's anything you can do anymore. In the moment that I put at your disposition, right? payrolls for people that don't come to the office and don't serve their job, they don't do nothing, They don't do their contribution to the citizen for the money that actually he takes from the citizen And I'm not talking about 1500-2000 lei (350€-450€) I'm talking about paychecks of 1400€ to 1500€ Well, in my supervision a lady came from DGASPC Vrancea, a person I've never seen before Another one came from DGASPC Sector 3 or wherever she worked at, which also she was coming at work whenever she was pleasing They weren't coming to work, I had to confirm their clocking, which I did not confirm I stated, with objections \"the presence of X lady is not confirmed\" I made sure by writing towards the people of the Ministry of the Interior they are monitoring the access into the institution Cause' you can't just go like \"Engage\" and done, you've teleported to your workplace. And done, you sign the registry, you clock-in. You must go through some turnstiles that work with some magnetic cards It's all video-taped The twist is that I wrote in a complaint towards the disciplinary comittee every aspect of it and I attached some evidence. This was happening in 2018,  when mr. Paul Stanescu was in office but maybe, this gentleman... \"C'mon, Tudor, be cool!\" \"It's not the right time\" \"What in the... seriously now, what do you need more?\" \"What? You're not happy with the public public administration? \"Well, it's fine, but it this isn't right\" \"C'mon, let it go, you mind your own business... It ain't the time right now\" \"I just told you\" These are the answers! What can he tell you? If they actually wanted to do something, they would do it institutionally they wouldn't just close the file at the Disciplinary Commision with all those evidence. this mr. Paul Stanesc, he wouldn't just close the file. He would've done something! \"Dude, dude wait a second, come over here!\" \"I'll personally come at 8 in the morning at your office\" \"Lets see, bro! Are you all really at work?\" He would've sent a boy from the party, councilman, right? \"You, go, see what those are doing over there, brother.\" \"Are they going to the office or are they getting 7000 RON for absolutely nothing ?\" About public officials that work VS. those that do nothing At the structure where I was working within the Ministry of Culture there were two employees.... So, gents! To be clear! The Ministry of Culture is on trial in 1000 cases for some quite sizable amounts of money At the litigation department there are two ladies that that take these 1000 cases they also take everything that is administrative paperwork and the Opinion of legality in the Ministry At the dignitary cabinet there are three ladies director of cabinet At marketing and advertising or whatever it's called public information, whatever, 15 people And at the Legal Department only 2 people. Why, I ask you now? A definition of the clan system: \"We've done this together\" It's a clan. It's like a clan. If you don't know someone so they will recommend you, or somehow to find a way in... You know what really grind my gears? To earn someone's trust, you're not introduced as -it isn't my situation but I've witnessed this- you're not introduced as a capable person, smart, witty \"He's done this and realized that.\" \"He's friends with X person and pulled some strings with this other guy.\" I mean, the clan system was together when things got done, and it works! Right now, it's \"knock-out\", they can't even come to their senses Everyone who's on a seat in public administrations, they got to wait now. and they are actually waiting to see what's the outcome of this With their daddies, because that's how the system of a clan works. Who is our leadership? He's gone! Who's coming next? Right now it's chaos, nobody moves a finger. Put yourself in someone's shoes who has 750€ worth of mortgage and a paycheck of 1300€ Two childs maybe Would you raise your voice? Or would you say: \"Lets see what I have left to eat\" \"Well I'm 40 y/o I got 20 years left and then, that's it.\" \"And I won't change anything anyways.\" \"Because 30 years went by since the communist era nothing much has changed\" \"I live my life like this, two vacations a year, pray to God my children won't get sick...\" This is what we're talking about, right? And who are you expecting to jump up and say something? Go and start a revolution! \"Come on, be against me and say something to me\" There still are some smart guys amongst them that know the law and push things And you don't mess with them. And they know how to play you, like, lets see what's the deal with him, let check. \"Lets see, one click away. Ok, his sister's working there, his mother is working there. Ok, you're gone\" \"He disturbed us... He even has a foul-mouth\" He's not happy after all this time he sucked from the Romanian state, under my authority? \"You've mistaken, bye\" And then he unleashes his dogs on you, right? I had it happen to me. And what will you do then? A single mother with two kids, for example, we keep seeing mostly women in public administrations, right? There are some men but mostly women, right? What can she do? What will she say? She does her best to go unnoticed, when her boss is giving her too much work she gets a medical-leave. Her kid has problems, so she won't assume it on her signature, because she thinks, obviously. \"Wait a second... I'm going on vacation\" Is there any solution? The selection of public officials must be done on competence criteria This is not hard at all. This can be done by an HR company that I think they would go out of their way and do it for free. \"Alright! For the Romanian state I will do this!\" \"Look, I'll put together a system and the most qualified can sign up\" \"We can select them electronically, or however you want, everything done with transparency\" I mean, really? All you need is the will to do this! But who do you think will... ? Do you see all these discussions? Elections are coming! \"Well, let's see. About 4 milion public officials,  who do you think they will vote?\" Now, if I was a sane public official I would say \"Wait a minute, I earn 2100€ a month\" \"Well what? Have I gone crazy? Viorica isn't good? (Prime-Minister) \"She isn't capable of nudging us anyways, so I'll just sit and do nothing\" if your head doesn't know what to ask, I stare back at it and I'm watching how passive it is, right? and I say \"Yes, boss, yes, of course...\" or I tell her straight-forward \"It can't be done\" \"Why?\"\n\"I don't know, you find a reason.\" And she won't know what to do. So, this way, as a public official mentally sane, I don't worry too much I vote the same guys, because everything is fine. What else do I personally need?"}

[another reporter] - Why though? *some comments on the use of the expression \"party firms\" [man] - As they usually do their job in this country. ASPHALT. AN INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY RECORDER [RADIO] The fantastic republic of Romania. [radio presenter] My friends, the party clientele is free to steal. Romania is once again the country of wrongdoing. We will talk a bit about the National Programme for Local Development. Recorder.ro has investigated this terrifying phenomenon, they've published an investigative documentary on the theft committed through PNDL (...) [reporter] 2 months ago we started driving on the least frequented roads of the country to see how the biggest programme of investment in the rural areas since the 1989 Revolution is developing. 9 million people live here, in the rural areas, almost half of the population, people at which the politicians have always looked down on. The Romanian rural area was not a priority when the investment budgets were set in Bucharest. The National Programme for Local Development, created by Liviu Dragnea in 2013, should have repaired this injustice. 10 billion euros had been allocated for modernization projects and half of this budget went to what should have taken these villages out of the medieval times: replacement of the barely paved country-side roads with asphalted ones. We went on the field to witness this transformation and we discovered that the reality had been distorted by the politicians through their speeches: It is not the farmers who gain from this programme, but the party firms that cash in money and leave behind roads that wreck at first rain. We've studied the documents of acquisition, we've talked with the mayors, builders and project planners. We've pieced together the information we've gathered in order to understand by which means the theft is made. from the asphalt works done through PNDL. [reporter] The correct way to asphalt a road means respecting a strict formula from which you cannot deviate if you want the work to last over time. To be more precise, when you step on a properly asphalted road, you're not only stepping on a layer of asphalt, but on a complex structure formed of 4 obligatory layers. At the construction, a 20 cm layer of ballast  is laid first - this is the cheapest material of all those to be used. Then comes the so-called cylindrical crushed stone layer, a hard stone that gives endurance to this complex structure. Over this layer, a first round of asphalt is laid with a  thickness of 6 cm, that has a linking role. At last, another 4 cm of a different type of asphalt are laid, made precisely to last under road traffic. But not all constructors are concerned with making a long-lasting road, but rather a profitable one. Therefore, in complicity with the mayors and other authorities of control, the constructors end up reducing the thickness of the layers to keep the money allocated to the acquisition of the materials. Or, even worse, to give up completely on one of the four layers: Either on the one of crushed stone, either on the ballast one, or on one of the two layers of asphalt. In case of extreme greed, the constructor can even give up on all three layers that form the base and lay the asphalt directly on the ground. This way, the money for the materials remains in the pockets of the contructor. The state gets to pay as if the road had been built according to the book and receives in return a poorly-done work that will collapse not long after the inauguration. In Schitu (commune), from Olt county, this theft \"recipe\" seems to be respected entirely. [reporter] - Have a look here, this is a layer of earth. They had laid asphalt directly on the field. [man] - How is it possible to lay asphalt directly on the field? Since it was paved directly on the field, you can just scrape it, they will pose with a car that places the stone to make people think the work was done well. - How will it possibly last? A lot of cars were damaged on these roads, as can be seen from the traces of oil SCHITU COMMUNE OLT COUNTY 2 km of communal road were asphalted in 2014 through PNDL. The project costed 400.000 euros, but it was done so badly that you can break the asphalt with your own hands. [reporter] -It broke like a biscuit. We've confronted the mayor of Schitu with the situation from the field. [reporter] - Is this a road modernized through  PNDL? MARIAN LUNGANU. THE MAYOR OF SCHITU COMMUNE [mayor of Schitu] - Yes, PNDL 1. [reporter] - Was it modernized? [mayor] - Yeah, that's how you call it, modernized. [reporter] - Well, what did you modernize? What is this? - Asphalt. [reporter] - Is this how asphalt is supposed to look like? [mayor] - Yes. [reporter] - What is the width that this asphalt should have had? [mayor]- 6 centimeters. [reporter] - Let's see how much it (actually) has. [reporter] - Have at look at this, it's thinner than a slice of bread! [reporter] - 2.5 centimeters. [mayor] - 3, 3, yes, and a half, yes. [reporter] - Why was this work done this way? [mayor] - So, I have... I will repeat once more, because [stuttering], as such, it's not that the builder took... he also took the responsibility to, he said he will lay the second layer. The constructor made many commitments, but did not respect any of them. According to the initial project for the Schitu road, there should have been laid 2 layers of asphalt, 4 times thicker than what had actually been made. Mayor Lunganu doesn't seem to have learnt anything from this story after all. This year, he obtained another tranche of funds through PNDL for the asphalting of another segment of road. He is building it with the exact same constructor. [reporter] - What is going to be made here? [mayor] - So, (a road with) asphalt bitumen. [reporter] - An asphalted road? [mayor] - Yes. So the road that connects Schitu commune with Lisa village, where [stuttering] the students will be transported on the shortest route. [reporter] - So you are building the road with a firm that wrecked one of your roads, are you saying you are building 2 more kilometers with them now? [mayor] - Let me explain to you... the contract made in 2011... could not have been terminated as the work was still ongoing, ongoing meaning that I couldn't have terminated the contract, as there was made no reception to the road that... so... that is the difference with the other place. [reporter] - And what's your guarantee that this road will be long-lasting and will not turn to dust? [mayor] - Guarantee [that] I will supervise the work with the chief of the building site,  I will be here permanently, I will have the chief here that will permanently come and verify the work. So, the more the mister that won the auction hurries, he will finish this road, and then repair the other one. *trying to reproduce his grammatical mistakes So, it will be fully repaired. [reporter]- And after he finishes repairing that road he will probably repair this one as well.        \n [mayor] - Then the reception is signed. [mayor] -Well, he won't [have to] repair it once he builds it, he finishes this one and then repairs the other one. There, we have all the clues to believe that the second segment will not last long either. Take a look at the gravel that's supposed to support the asphalt in this commune. It is thinner than flour. We also asked for the opinion of an expert in constructions regarding the quality of the materials used at Schitu. [MARCEL IORDACHE, technician constructor] - I will go with the option that this is a joke. A bad joke... You cannot do such thing - to be the worst worker as it is a total compromising of the work. [reporter] - Is there stone here? [mayor] - Yes, there is. [reporter] - This feels more like sand then stone. [mayor] What's written... we have a chief of the the building site, he checks on everything, yes! The builder with which the mayor of Schitu insists to asphalt the roads is, in fact, an association of two firms: Marsilva Com and Condor Păduraru SRL. The owner of Condor is Sorin Păduraru, a character involved in a massive corruption file that was aimed at getting Darius Vâlcov. 4 years ago, Păduraru admitted in front of the public prosecutors from DNA to having paid Vâlcov a 10% commission from the contracts obtained with public money. We called Sorin Păduraru to ask him if the works done at Schitu were also made through political influence and commissions given to the party. [reporter] -Was there collected any commission for this road built at Schitu? Sorin Păduraru: Mister, if you were a public prosecutor... you're approaching me as if you were from the National Anti-Corruption Department.... How would I know? I have no knowledge of that, I don't even believe it to be the case. [mayor to the vice-mayor]- You were right, man! You were right! In front of the camera, mayor Lunganu denied as well that he was politically influenced when he chose who to contract with for the asphalt works. But, as he was leading us to the municipality, the Recorder mic left in his pocket taped how he was advising with the vice-mayor on how to hide the truth. Audio recording: The same way he approached the others! He approached those mayors the same way, he even made one say \"This is how the order came, from above.\" [from the investigation \"Dumnezeul Achizițiilor, also available on Youtube:] - Some phone calls coming from where? [mayor] Well, both from the centre and... - From the party? - From the centre. Audio recording: But they are trying to speak badly of that one... But I won't say [a thing], it is pointless. *inaudible* They will try from the party... We weren't able to terminate [the contract]... [mayor] - Is this a party firm? -No, no, so it is legal. And it won the cheapest offer. But everything was legal. We couldn't take them to court because we would have lost. So, we looked into this ourselves, we have our own jurist, because the road is still under work... We have our own jurist. He says: Mister mayor, do not start a trial as they will win, because you cannot terminate the contract. The base... and not even in the contract can you... look, there is no clause in the contract on termination. [reporter] - The municipality was the one to lose in this case. [mayor] -Yes, yes, yes. That is how things are. [reporter] - Well, why is that? [mayor] - You know it is in our nature to make mistakes. [doubt] [reporter] -This is an intentional \"mistake\". [mayor] - No, it wasn't intentional, sometimes mistakes are made. We tried to find out from the firms that won the contract how come the mistakes were so big and advantageous to them. The owner of Condor claims that his firm was involved only on paper. [owner of Condor] - I have nothing to do with that, I did not do the work. Marsilva built it. Around 8 years ago, I helped this firm at the auction. I gave them my support. A newly established firm must fulfill some conditions in order to be able participate at auctions. And it cannot do it by itself, it needs the support of a bigger firm. [reporter] We went to Slatina, at the headquarters of the firm Marsilva Com, the one that laid the asphalt. No one there wanted to give us any explanations. The employees told us that they are busy with the forms they need to fill out in order to participate at other auctions. The result was this short interview between walls. [reporter] - At this address the headquarters of a firm that built a road are located... [employee] - Yes [reporter] - [...] a road where the asphalt simply disappeared. [employee] - We don't know what to tell you. [reporter] - We request to speak with someone from the firm Marsilva Com SRL. [employee] - There is no such thing as Marsilva. reporter: [doubt] How so? reporter: - Look, it's written here on the wall Marsilva Com SRL... [reporter] - And you, miss, are in the headquarters of the firm. [employee] I don't know. I don't know. [reporter] - So, are you saying that we found you here randomly, that you were just passing by... employee: [raising tone] Mister, do you understand that I do not know? Do you? [another employee] - Please, we have stuff to do here, and we will not sit here... According to public data, Condor and Marsilva have cashed in by now, through PNDL, over 7 million euros. As a matter of fact, Olt was the number one county in 2018 regarding contracts conducted through PNDL, worth 51 million euros, 7 times more than a district like Brașov. [Locals] This is how it was wrecked, this is how it is done here, it's the norm. Faster and faster, they'll do whatever. They barely asphalted. That cannot be called asphalt. The way in which asphalt works were performed at Schitu seems to be the norm throughout the country. We went through multiple counties to check on the condition on the roads asphalted through PNDL. Inaugurated with grandeur few years ago, the roads now look catastrophically. TV (2015): An important investment, especially for the locals of Izvoarele commune, was welcomed few days ago. It is a road exactly as you can see, very well done, very well-built, to say so. 3 YEARS LATER PRICE: 1.600.000 € TV, 2013: Răcari city was celebrating for two days. On the first day, the completion of the communal road 43A Răcari - Ghimpați - Butimanu was marked. 6 YEARS LATER PRICE: 2.000.000 € DIMITRIE CANTEMIR VILLAGE, GIURGIU COUNTY. PRICE: 600.000 € CIOCĂNEȘTI COMMUNE, DÂMBOVIȚA COUNTY. PRICE: 3.700.000 € [Dragnea] - It was definitely not easy to develop this programme and now it's working really well. It works wonders, to say so. The National Programme for Local Development replaced the European funds designated for the asphalting of roads. This means that instead of building with money coming from Bruxelles,  we chose to spend from the national budget. The mayors were happy about it, as Liviu Dragnea's programme entailed less beaurecracy as compared to the projects funded by the EU. We used to sign tens of thousand of pages of documentations, requests of funding, requests of payment. We used to send inclusively copies after Official Monitors, own risk declarations, our shoe size, our well-being, whatever you want. Our salvation bore the name of Liviu Dragnea. The National Programme for Local Development: flexible, thin, without bureaucracy. [Dragnea] - All it takes is for the mayor to come to Bucharest with 2 documents, and not trucks of documents. 2 documents to be brought to Bucharest. [reporter] Less documents, but also less supervision. Regarding the projects made through European funds, there were inspections from the authority that allocated the money, When it comes to the PNDL, these on-field inspections were removed. We are now in Vâlcea district, on a communal road built with European funds. The differences are considerable. [reporter]  - This road is almost perfect. It looks as if it was laid a couple of days ago. [mayor] - Yes, and it was laid almost 9 years ago. It has no hole, no fissure, nothing. If you build them accordingly, with the base layer and the ballast and broken stone, it cannot get wrecked. [reporter] - Not even with tractors and trucks running over them? [mayor] - It doesn't matter. And it's not tractors that run here, it's big trucks. This road doesn't have a restriction on tonnage. Bizarrely enough, the road from Bărbătești, asphalted with European funds, is cheaper than the one from Schitu, built with PNDL funds. We've obtained the documents of acquisition of the two roads and we saw that the value of the asphalt laid through PNDL is two times higher than of the one laid with European funds. This, even though the auctions took place in the same period of time. and in the same geographical area. The prices are 2 or even 3 times higher in the case of footbridges. The same with grooves. We have confronted several mayors and a lot of them complained that it is almost impossible for them to discover the frauds commited by the constructor. They put the blame on the chief of the construction work, which was chosen by them. At Bărbătești though, we can see that in reality, it all depends on the mayor and that a mayor in good faith can avoid fraud. When the work was completed, where I had my doubts and I was under the impression that the layer of asphalt does not have the required 10 cm of thickness and in order not to have any problems at the inspection, I asked the constructor if he agrees to take samples. Samples from various places - places chosen by me and not by the constructor. And, to my surprise, all samples without exception ranged from 12 cm to 18 cm at curves. How much does this one have? - 15 cm. Mayor Constantin Banacu, member of PSD (Social Democrat Party) built roads through PNDL as well and he built them well. His example shows that this program has the potential to function if the mayors don't give in to the temptation to step into the dirty games of the party firms that compromise the works in order to misappropriate the governmental funds. When the theft takes place, we in fact witness a chain complicity: builder - chief of construction - mayor - State Inspectorate for Constructions - Ministry of Development. Have a look! This is the asphalt you laid through PNDL. [ION TOMA, MAYOR OF MOVILENI COMMUNE, OLT DISTRICT]: Yes, mister director, but take a look at this centre we built... [reporter] - Look under your feet at the laid layer of asphalt. [mayor] - Well, I am looking at what's under my feet, but look, I have a chief of construction that takes responsibility for everything. I am not responsible for everything... So, mister, were you not aware of the situation until now? Well, I was, but here it shrunk as it happened with the others, it must be repaired... MOVILENI COMMUNE. OLT DISTRICT So the road shrunk. It's one thing to tilt, another thing to shrink. \n   *said in an incorrect way And if you take a look at district roads you can see that they shrunk as well. What are these shrinkings? So... the asphalt dilates, how should I know? Something is happening there! - What exactly? An infiltration of water, or of something else. Due to rain. Ion Toma is the mayor of Movileni commune, in Olt county. He wasted 1.2 million euros, from PNDL funds, on a road with only 1 layer of asphalt. The base of the road is 30% thinner in comparison with other similar roads. The result: not long after asphalting, the road was wrecked. Are you satisfied with the quality of the work done here? [mayor] - Deep down, I am satisfied the moment I see a smile on the faces of my citizens, that they have decent enough conditions to walk around in slippers and everything useful in our days. The mayor offers to give us a tour of the commune to show us his accomplishments, but he encounters a minor impediment. - With which car did you come? -  With the [Dacia] Logan, but I have to go take the keys. [reporter] - Well then, from which car is the key that you're holding? - Excuse me? - To which car does this key belong? [mayor] - Oh, it is not from ... [me]. [reporter] - You're extraordinary, let's take your car now [since you hold these keys]. [mayor] - No, I am going to take the keys for the Logan, I am not going to run. [reporter] - He went to take the keys from the Logan of the municipality as he could not have taken his personal car, as it would have made him look bad. He came here with that car over there. 10 years ago, before he became a mayor, Ion Toma was among the poorest children in the commune, and he would not back off when it came to performing the lower tasks in the party. He ended up being a security guard at the Municipal Council and then suddenly he became the mayor of the commune. He bought nicer clothes, a foreign car and he handled the administration the best he could. The moment the asphalt is laid, the heel of your shoe... if your heel doesn't immerge into it, then the road was built well. *repeats himself [reporter] - And what the case with this road when you did that? [mayor] - I think that's how it was! [reporter] - How was it? [mayor] - I supervised this work and with my heel I tried not to immerse into the base layers. Frătești commune, district of Giurgiu. This portion of the road was built on 2014, through PNDL (National Programme For Local Development). It costed 400.000 euros. [MARIAN CĂRĂȚEANU, the mayor of this commune]: Believe me, I am even ashamed to meet you on the street and to hear you say: \"This mayor... What's up with him? Is he stupid? Can't he see in what state this road is?\" Do people not find me guilty [of it]? People have all the reasons to find mayor Marian Cărățeanu guilty. He should have supervised the work and should have made sure that it is done well when he accepted to pay the firm that built it. Now he declares himself indignant and tries to pose as the victim. [reporter] - How would you qualify the situation here? That, in theory, it would be a modernized road? But you can no longer see the asphalt. [mayor] - Well, what could be seen here since it was completely wrecked? It’s shameful. Look at it! Do you see it? In some parts it still lasted, more or less, look at it. It more or less lasted here. But over there, it didn't. And it's gone, look at it! Where could we see the 17 billion RON spent here by the constructor? Which 17 billion RON do you want to see? This is it! From km 0 till the very end. After 5 years, the mayor decided to sue the firm that built the road. He considers the laws to be too lenient, thus allowing the constructors to do whatever they want. They win contracts because they leave the values low at auctions, so they’d get the contract and then perform an additional act, if possible… And then, after the guarantee (period) expires: “Farewell, it’s on you now to deal with it!” The road at Frătești was built by Gecor SRL, a firm with strong connections with the highest ranking government officials. It belongs to Cusă family, known for their friendship with the leaders of the Social Democrat Party from Buzău county. [left] NICULAE BĂDĂLĂU, Minister of Economy; [centre] GEORGE CUSĂ; [right] RĂZVAN CUC, Minister of Transport George Cusă, the son of the director of the firm, was the godfather of Gabriel Bădălău at his marriage *it’s an orthodox thing to be godparents for a married couple* Gabriel Bădălău being the son of the current Minister of Economy. He's also close with Răzvan Cuc, the Minister of Transport. The firms owned by Cusă family are among the biggest beneficiaries of the National Programme for Local Development (PNDL). The latest major accomplishment: having asphalted through PNDL a road that had already been asphalted through this programme by another firm. We are now on a road in Greaca commune, in Giurgiu county. It was modernized with half a million euros sometime last Autumn. What’s interesting about it is that underneath this road there is another road that was also modernized through PNDL, also of around a few hundred thousand euros. Yes, they have laid two roads, one on top of the other one. PETRE LIVIU HOLDĂRESCU (spokesman for the municipality of Greaca): We had to redo the work as it degraded. It was full of holes. [reporter] - Well, why is that? [spokesman] -  How should I know? It could have been low quality materials, low quality execution , what can I say? [reporter] Normally, a road like this has a minimum duration of 15 years. [spokesman] Well, it might be minimum 15 years on paper, but here it barely lasted for 2 years. What can I say? I am not a specialist. [reporter] - Well then you built the same road twice? [spokesman] Well, I can build it 100 times if I want to. [reporter] Doesn't this feel as if you wasted money? [spokesman] No, no. No, we do not consider it to be the case. In the last few years,  the firms owned by Cusă family won contracts worth over 20 million euros through PNDL. But no state authority ever questioned them for the poorly done works that used public money. So we thought we should be the ones to question them. Look at the palace this firm built as their headquarters. Here is the money from the holes in the national roads. Good afternoon! We're Recorder, from Bucharest, from the press. We're working on a material and we would like to speak with someone from this firm... [employee] We kindly ask you to leave the building. [reporter] You didn't even wait for me to see what I wanted [to ask]... We want to know this firm's position on the road that it built and it is now in ruins. [employee] Please, this is a commercial society... [reporter] ... that builds roads with public money. [employee[ Please, leave. Can I least leave my contact here so someone would contact me? No, no! Does no one from the firm want to talk with us? In front of the building, we met Cornel Cusă, one of the two brothers in charge of the group of firms. We want to ask you a few questions concerning a road that Gecor firm built and is now in ruins. No one from the headquarters would talk with us and we would like to ask you a few questions... I don't have any comments to make about this, I really don't. [reporter] But you are one of the representatives of the firm. You're the son of the owner. [Cusă] Are you really sure about that? [reporter:] -Yes. [Cornel Cusă:] -Very Good. We took pictures of the roads built by Gecor and other firms that have asphalted through PNDL and we went to Liviu Dragnea, the creater of this programme, to show them to him. We met him on a campaign trip in Argeș county. [reporter] - I'm going to show you photos from what we recorded of some roads asphalted through PNDL Look in what state they are now, shortly after being asphalted. [Dragnea] - How many roads are there? [reporter] - For example here, only here, there are 7 roads, but we saw at least 15,16 of them out of 30. Half of the roads we've seen from PNDL 1 look like this. [Dragnea] - Bravo! I do not know whether they are part of PNDL or not, but as in any other field, I don't think we can have 100% efficiency. If things really are as you say, it means there were some people that wasted the money. The state institutions, the centre for inspection of constructions and others have to verify. [reporter] - When you created this programme, did you make sure there would be certain instruments available in order to avoid this fraud? [Dragnea] - When I created this programme, I made sure the countryside would no longer be in mud. And it's getting out of mud! [reporter] - There are party firms that built these roads, do you think they were favoured [compared to others] with this programme? [Dragnea] - Party firms? We are done with this, little rooster. *literal translation [reporter] But why? [Dragnea] He used this expression *referring to \"party firms\"* to... TWO DAYS LATER TÂRGOVIȘTE. 19 MAY 2019: [Dragnea] We invest in the Romanian countryside, we invest in infrastructure, we invest in the future of this country! We asphalt the roads that have never been asphalted, We started building the highways that have never been built, And we will continue, regardless of the obstacles set by these bastard former members of the secret police! Our communes, in a few years, will be more beautiful than the communes of Western Europe! Because the Romanian nation is also more beautiful! Thank you and God help us!

With the donors We have achieved the required amount of blood and blood products in the county And we always gave it to the city of Iasi, for the people who would go to have surgery in Iasi So that's it: through work. Through work with the donors A goodwill diary - a journey through the country where it is normal to do good A group of citizens from Tecuci who come to Barlad regularly to donate blood Next week I'm back again We don't have a blood transfusion center in Tecuci, and so we found this one here It's handier, closer, we've always been welcomed here nicely And the first question before donating was: What was the reason we were donating for, was it for someone in particular? And we said : no; we are donating for anyone who needs it They come firstly to help To help, that's the point, when there's an accident Where there is a problem in the family, they mobilize Let's see how I feel.. -You'll feel just fine Yeah?   -Yeah Generally, I try and sit with every new donor.

We try and create a calm and trustful atmosphere, so they come back That's the point: that they come back next time there is a case You're welcome Violeta Nistor's great sorrow is that the blood transfusion center operates in a building built in 1934, which has not been refurbished for 20 years now.. No one allowed us to install an air pipe, which is not even that significant So, a pipe... That's it, these are the laws! At the beginning of this year, the center was refurbished after Violeta Nistor got a sponsorship through the  ' A chance for life' programme We came back to see what's changed Barlad County Blood Transfusion Centre I felt valued and understood.. For 20 years, there haven't been many changes No investment was possible Not even funds from the Ministry of Health Everyone that comes here is excited Excited - and I can even see people's reactions Ordinary people, from the countryside, from all social backgrounds, they are all excited to see comfort Indeed, it looks much more presentable Before, it looked a bit depressing; but keeping in mind that you had to do it, you would do it anyway You would exclude the landscape and perform your duty I don't know, in the whole county, how many centers they invested in Yes, they should invest nonetheless, because blood can't be replaced And a blood bag in an emergency, in an accident, it is vital"}

Că niște medici și câteva asistente pot să facă un bine fără să ceară nimic în schimb. Că poți avea încredere în acest bine necondiționat. Am adunat într-un film documentar câteva povești și câțiva oameni care, fără să-și dorească neapărat asta, au scris istoria paliației din România.\n\nHOSPICE Casa Speranței asigură servicii gratuite de îngrijiri paliative pentru adulți diagnosticați cu cancer și pentru copii cu diferite boli, având speranța de viață limitată (cancer, leucemie, distrofii neuro-musculare, malformații congenitale, insuficiențe cronice de organ și alte boli rare incurabile).\n\nPuteți susține financiar activitatea Hospice Casa Speranței printr-o donație sau prin redirecționarea procentului de 3.5% din impozitul pe venit.\n\nFilm realizat cu sprijinul Suvoda", "transcript": "♪ (Romanian song) When you appear, seniorita, in the park, in late afternoon, ♪ there are lillies petals flowing around you ♪ Your eyes carry sweet passions and glow from sins, but your smile is...

You feel a terrible fear of the unknown. Then follows a sense of self preservation and you're afraid of death. Then you start to deny it. It's a normal psychological response. \"No, no, no, no!\" \"No, it did not happen to me, it can't be true!\" And then the battle starts. What is worst about this disease is that it's not... there's nothing you can do, you don't know how to react... It's with you all the time, you know? So, it sticks to your mind, so to say... And, besides that, the worst thing you can do is to think that if it has happened to you once, it can happen to you anytime. This is the biggest fight, to get over these moments. You give the start! Come on! Violeta has undergone a cancer related surgery 7 years ago, and now helps the hospice patients to get over People who find themselves in these kind of situations only want... This is what I wanted and I saw that this is how others react too, they only want to... Be treated like normal people. I mean, I don't like people tiptoeing  around me... And... I think that for a time, I also wanted to be left alone. I'm not going to explode! You know, leave me alone, because... I needed... my inner peace. At the beginning, you think you're invincible.

This used to be a really nice town My first trip to Romania was in 1975 And it was a little bit by chance. In the days before computers, I went into a travel agency And... and the lady there looked through a brochure and she suggested a week in Transylvania. It wasn't somewhere we thought of going, but it sounded like an adventure, so we booked, got on a plane and landed in Bucharest. My memory of that first visit is that when we landed, there was a tank pointing its guns at the plane and I thought: \"Goodness, where have we gone to?\" And it was my first time in a communist country. And... it was a little bit like going back a 100 years. Arriving at Brașov, I immediately fell in love with that city. In those days, you had to be with a guide all the time, it was a guided tour and after dinner, one evening, we were fed up with being herded around by a guide, so we pretended to have a headache and we went up to our room and then we escaped Apoi am fugit and we got a trolleybus to the outskirts of the city, we'd see a little bit more of Brașov. But on the way back, when we got to the stop, near the hotel, we just couldn't get off, there were just so many people packed into the trolleybus, and then we went further and we ended up getting lost and at that point, a young man came up to us and said \"I can see you're lost, can I help you?\" He said \"Yes, I can show you to the hotel Capitol\" where we we staying. „I live near there, why don't you come and visit me and my wife, I've just got married!\" And on the way back to the hotel we stopped by his apartment And... they became my first friends in Romania. One thing I noticed straight away was that As we entered the flat he turned the television on at full volume, and I remember the voice of Ceaușescu belling out of this television but he told me he had to do that because he didn't want the neighbors to hear a western voice in his apartment. And... I got fascinated with the country and I went back in '77 and once again in the late 70's, but then there was a gap of 10 years. I got married, I started a hospice in Kent, in my home county. I didn't really have time to get back to Romania 'till 1989. And that was the January before the December Revolution, and I think then I saw Romania at its very worst. We arrived in the middle of the night and there were people queuing for bread at 4 o'clock in the morning. It was very cold and when we visited my friends in Brașov, they had very little to eat and it was a very difficult visit, because we stayed in the hotel in Brașov, and there, he communists were dancing the night away and enjoying like a 13 course dinner and I remeber after three courses, I said to my wife: \"Oh, I can't do it anymore, this is just awful\" because we'd seen our friends the day before with so little and it was just such a huge contrast and that really upset us. And of course we followed the events in November '89 when the Berlin Wall fell and I remember praying that, you know, the same would happen in Romania. It took a bit longer, it wasn't until December but we saw the events unfold on television. In the very center of Bucharest, the new democracy is now more or less secure. I couldn't take my eyes off, I watched everything because obviously I had friends there, I knew the country, I couldn't telephone my friends... And on the 2nd of January, I got on a plane and flew to Romania. I remember when I arrived in Brașov, it was snowing very hard and I was worried they might think I was a Securitate agent trying to flee the city. But I arrived in the middle of night, my friends didn't know I was coming, but they were safe and I stayed a few days. The snow continued and so my flight back was cancelled, the airport was closed and it was as a result of that that I spent a few more days in Brașov. I asked my friend to take me to the cancer hospital and when I walked in there, I saw a young man die in terrible pain and I always say that it was in that moment that I thought this is maybe the way I could help. The doctor in the hospital, he sat on his bed and he said: „I wish I could do something for him, but I have no drugs, there is nothing I can do\". And it was really heart wrenching to see this young man he was only 27, die on his own, in pain. Hospice care is also about those left behind. Barbara lost her young son two years ago, he was a competitive skier, when a rare form of cancer made him paralyze almost over night. \"I knew that he will die And... I was down Mr. Graham came and supported also me. People generally believe that they are all alone in their pain And it's... a great help... to see that someone that you didn't know also helps you. Hospice Casa Speranței was founded in 1992, in Brașov So glad to see you! Thank you so much for coming, this is Christian Sylvia Jarret was the first nurse working at Hospice Casa Speranței Ah, that's one of my patients... Well, Graham said to me one day In fact, I think he left me a note and he asked me if I would go to Romania and I said \"Oh, yes, I will come when I'm on holiday\". \"Oh, no\", he said, no, no... \"You must come... ...for longer\". So, I thought well I will approach my husband in the morning and see what he says. And when I told him, he said \"Yes\". I thought he would say \"Don't be so ridiculous\", you know But he did't. The first time I came to Romania was actually February '92. It did seem rather cold and inhospitable, really. In the winter, when it's very, very cold, we would get dressed to go to bed. We would have the oven on to keep us warm. But the Romanians managed, so we managed too. So I started to visit patients who lived in blocks of flats mainly. Their main fear was to be in pain at night and it's always worse at night, isn't it? And I could always converse with them: „Aveți durere, dureri? (Do you have pain?) Aveți voma?” (Do you vomit?) There was a young man, he was 21, Mihai. He had cancer of the spine. And on the Friday when I saw him, he said to me: „You won't let me die, will you? Because I want to go to university, I've started university and I want to go back\" And I said: \"Mihai, I'd love to keep you with me and I'd love for you to go back to university\". And I said \"Shall we pray for you?\" \"Ah, but what religion are you?\" I said \"Well, I belong to the Church of England And you belong to the Church of Romania\". I said \"But there is only one God, he only had one son, and when he took his son to be with him, he left us with the Holy Spirit.\" \"Oh, well that's what I believe!\" So, it wasn't a problem at all. So the next day was Saturday. I told my husband we'll go and see Mihai When we got there, he had died in the night. And our son was about a similar age, so I was thinking that could be our son... But it was lovely because the family... they welcomed us in and there was Mihai lying in his coffin and... they said \"Can you, please, pray for us\". Things like that you don't forget. Sylvia Jarret is still involved in humanitarian actions around the world. Right, so... Yes, here, in this area, this is where it was... It was taken from this side here. And you can see... It's a little further back. The first shovel was done somewhere in the front, there. The first shovel... this is the mayor, Ghișe, a lady volunteering from England, Grham Perolls and me. This was the first spade in the ground to build up this Hospice. It was thrilling, though. Mister Nelu When we were registering the charity in Romania, we had to have a lot of documents and so I used a translation company and I was sitting in the waiting room and Nelu was next to me and we started talking and he told me that he was there to have some documents translated because his son had a very rare illness, and and I promised him that I would try and find out something about his condition from the doctors in the UK. Yes, this is how I met Graham. Graham told me that he talked to an important professor from the St Thomas Hospital who told him \"Bring him over so I can see him\". And this is how I ended up in England with Dragoș. And then, through that, when Sylvia, our first nurse, came to Romania, obviously she couldn't speak Romanian, and she couldn't find addresses like \"Block number 60, scara B\". You know, it was too difficult, so I knew we needed to employ a driver and because I knew Nelu, Nelu became our first employee and our first driver. His English gradually, gradually improved and we could understand each other. There were situations when I was driving with Sylvia, the British nurse, and people were coming out with a coffee bag, with something... And of course, she wouldn't take it, Because they don't do that in England. And the families would ask me: \"She won't be back, will she?“ That's why she don't take anything, because she doesn't want to come back anymore\". \"No, ma'am, she'll be back, you'll see, you'll understand for yourselves\" It was a difficult beginning. Very early on we had problems with the authorities, So, when we tried to register the charity, we found there was quite a lot of opposition. They initially, I think, were very suspicious of this English woman coming and telling them about their patients. And I don't think they felt that it was really necessary. I was often going to negotiation with the National Insurance Agency with issues regarding palliative care, with suggestions... which were always seen as... And I was even told: \"All we need now is this and white magic\" A lot of people, I think, in Brașov, were quite suspicious of this organization \"Hospice Casa Speranței\", what do we actually do. I remember that back then people were quite suspicious when you were entering their home and were oferring to help. \"But what for?\" \"What do you want in return?\" The Transylvanian city of Brașov, Romania. A hospice team is busy at work. Patients who were once dying in loneliness and pain are now receiving the care they so desperately need. The doctor was coming home, without asking for money, without asking for anything... So that was new in itself. And the access to pain relief medicine was very difficult. Even now I remember a patient who had lung cancer and had terrible pain. And I was trying with common weak medicine and nobody knew what to do to him. And, somehow, the doctors were embarrassed to get into his ward because they didn't actually know, what they can still give to that patient. So, you were thinking, ok, you have cancer, it is advanced, it is painful... You were trying with metamizole, with the pain killers you had access to, and this was everything. Good morning! Daniela also used to work in an oncology hospital. \"I'm Daniela Moșoiu and I'm the medical director of Hospice Casa Speranței. I'm a doctor and I'm an oncologist as a training so I know a lot about the needs of these patients\". And I believe that what Hospice brings and what palliative care brought: \"Hold on, it's not... I mean, yes there is pain, but for this pain there are countless medicines\". Ok, so there is something that can be done! Hope When we were registering the charity, I asked the Romanian members to choose a name and they said Casa Speranței. When I came to Hospice and I heard it's called \"The House of Hope\" I told to myself: \"God, what a lack of creativity these people had!\" What do you still need the \"House of Hope\" for? And, for so many times, for so many times, we had relatives of the patients or the patients telling: \"They told us there's nothing that can be done, but you are called Hope\" They never say \"The House of Hope\", they just say \"You are Hope\". \"...and there must be something you can still do for me\". It may not be hope that they're going to live many years, but hope that maybe they're going to fulfill their dream to see a daughter who's about to get married or they want to do something in their garden... or just small steps to give hope to the next period of life. So I became comfortable with the word Hospice, House of Hope. I met someone who said to me: \"You know what? I want to live for two months, to get my pension, so that my wife will have money to buy fire wood for this winter... I'm Snow White! In 2002 and 2014, Hospice of Hope built in Brasov and Bucharest the first two hospitals with full service for children and adults We basically have two hospital, that we build from the ground. We cover four cities, offering home care, Bucharest, Brașov, Zărnești and Făgăraș. And another project, to open a new center near Bucharest, at Adunații Copăceni, a center that will be dedicated for children who can't be cured. In 27 years, Hospice of Hope helped over 30.000 patients and their families. I don't know if it's a small or a big number, but the most important thing is that we mattered in each of these 30.000 lives. The real core of Hospice is not just looking after the patient's disease, but the whole person. So you care for them emotionally, spiritually, socially and you don't just care for the patient, you care for the whole family. We had, so far, in Hospice three weddings. A couple of years ago, I was the godmother to that couple. They were older people who had loved each other for 22 years and who didn't want to pass through this moment of saying goodbye, without oficializing their love. And it was a very impressive moment, because, during the whole religious service, we were crying, we were laughing, it was something like a mix of emotions. and it was totally special because we have some great colleagues who wanted to create, as real as possible, the wedding context. We had limos, meaning the wheel chairs, we had the bride's bouquet, we had cake, we had the throwing of the bouquet we had all the steps as at a normal wedding The patient only lived for about three weeks after that and he said those were the best weeks of his life because he had made peace with everything around him. Every year, over 170.000 Romanians need palliative care. Only 9% benefit from it. I'm going to wear this, you know. Yeah... Sometimes I feel like a dad, you know... They don't really have any fathers in their families, they're mostly single parent families with issues and so on, so, somehow, they expect me to bring them this father balance in their life. Kids and teenagers from Hospice Casa Speranței discover therapy through art I had no clue what therapy through art means. We were thinking: \"Maybe they will put us to do some crafting or something alike...\" But when George came and told us about theater we were quite like: \"We? We never do this kind of things - I said - you can go look for something else... what can you do with us, games or... but not real theater\" And in the end... we ended up acting. We even performed Romeo and Julliet, we even did... you know, more advanced stuff.. We even had decorations, we had... a certain mood... so, they gained self confidence, They performed in front of hundreds of people... They cling to what they find here, with every fibre in their being. Somehow they managed to come to peace with themselves and with the future. I worked here until... my boy died. You can imagine that... Everything used to remind me about him. Everything. At the market, at the school, at the kindergarten, on the street, meeting friends, meeting some of his friends and colleagues and we weren't feeling well. Dragos, Mr Nelu's son, died of cancer on December 13th, 2011, at a Hospice in England. He was 27. Mister Nelu left Brasov, but worked for Hospice for 6 more years, in Bucharest. He retired in 2017. I wanted to say, that in general, you need to do some good too. The good has to be shared too, if you don't do it at the right moment, the next day it might be too late. Ether you won't be able to do it, eather the other one won't need it anymore. People get familiar with these services and, even if we discuss about companies, or about individuals, they all come to bring their contribution somehow. We even had the situation when a pensioner crossed the city with 50 lei (10 euros), because he had his pension, and he is aware, that we once took care of one of his neighbours. So it is impressive to see how simple people come to give a hand in such situations I really appreciate when our colleagues send us, after a day of fundraising, a report where they say: \"today we fundraised this money, corresponding to X days of hospital care\". And this is when you realize how important your work is how important it is to be there. Epilogue Children of Hospice Casa Speranței are singing along with Liviu Teodorescu at Romanian Athenaeum Hospice Casa Speranței covers four cities: Bucharest, Brașov, Făgăraș and Zărnești All services, home care and hospital care, are cost free for the patients.

This is worse than during the Middle Ages! No! A 10 billion euro project that should get the Romanian village out of the mud. Liviu Dragnea (PSD leader): The National Program for Local Development. Yes, it's a program that is very dear to me. Yes, I invented it, together with Sevil Shhaideh (former development minister - e.n.) How did a single light bulb cost 2,000 euros at Altan Tepe? 2,000 euros? Where did you get this story from? A story that turned into a party business This firm has zero turnover, zero revenues, zero expenses, no employees. How did you decide to give it this contract? Zero? Phone calls coming from where? Well... from the top. And from... From the party. From the top... Why did you bring Mr. Madalin Iscru to the ministry? I bring whoever I think I need to bring. The truth is that on the way to the top a lot falls through, we are too little for this war. Cheating with acquisitions! PSD's manoeuvres! This is what PSD does: A pencil costs 1 RON and they buy it for 70 RON, 80 RON! This is PSD! (Social Democratic Party) They make a lot of money like this! I invite you over to lunch, if you want to come, ok, if not... An investigation that brings to light a network lead by a priest How is it possible to take over a ghost firm and immediately win contract after contract with the public authorities? That's your opinion, we have nothing to... We will talk to you at another time... It's an incredible miracle! God makes miracles! That's why we serve Him, because He loves us and does miracles! THE PARTY DOES MIRACLES Sâmbata Nouă, Tulcea county. An isolated village where everything seems to be on the verge of collapsing. A couple of hundred people live here on the verge of poverty, similar to many who now live in Romanian villages. From the middle of these ruins a building emerges that seems to come from a different landscape: a villa set on three levels, surrounded by tall fences. It's the house of priest Madalin Iscru, who, for the past two years, has been guarding the community. May the great God have mercy our savior Jesus Christ to be with you all! God rises his Sun over those who are good and over those who are bad sends rain on those just and those unjust, helps everyone without making any distinction between them. The priest's car Volvo XC90 is worth €60.000 The car of the priestess: Mercedes GLE 350 worth €45.000 Madalin Iscru is not just a servant of God. When he takes off his clerical clothing, he becomes a business man with connections at the highest level. His wealth isn't connected only to the village he is from, but to all villages in Romania. Here's the winning recipe: 6 years ago, Liviu Dragnea (current leader of the Social Democratic Party - PSD), creates the National Local Development Program. The Ministry of Development is assigned to offer more than 10 billion euros to city councils all over the country. From this money construction companies are payed which are hired to modernize the villages infrastructure. Last summer, the priest Mădălin Iscru is appointed as councilor at the Ministry of Development under the direct coordination of Paul Stănescu, the deputy vice minister of Romania. A few weeks later, the priest takes over the company Hercinic LLC, a former neighborhood kiosk. It is a company that has its HQ in an apartment, with zero turnover, zero employees and zero experience in construction work. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Development where Iscru worked as a consultant starts allocating funds to Iscru's companies, with the help of the city councils. He is given money for the renovation of schools, local clinics and community centers. In just 4 months, he got over 130 contracts. A record. In the top of direct acquisitions made through SEAP (electronic system of public acquisitions) Hercinic is on the top position. This means that a company with zero turnover performs better than corporations that have thousands of employees. Gîrliciu Village, Constanța county Let Bucharest see the Gîrliciu village! A special village! A rare beauty... Not even in the movies ... Take a look... Have you ever seen anything like it? Just like in the Middle Ages! To understand how the company Hercinic managed to win 130 contracts in only 4 months we went to the Garliciu village from Constanta. Look at this mess! This is a village? Unbelievable! Look at all the mud you dragged over! Yes... Constantin Cinpoiașu, mayor Hello! Hello ma'am! How are you mister mayor? Good. Is the head of the school here? Yes. Let's go around to avoid all this... Mud. There is a lot of mud here in the village. Here we want to build a sports hall and a football field. A modern football field. With artificial grass and fences all around so that the kids can practice as much sport as possible. As much sport as possible. The sport field will be built by Iscru's company. Hercinic got from the city hall in just a few minutes, several contracts summing up to 300 thousand euros. How did you select this company? How did we select this company? Yes. Well, we got it from SEAP... Ok... And so this company was selected. How did you get it from SEAP? Using the public acquisitions system, right? Yes, yes, yes! And you found it there? Yes! And what was so impressive about this company? The seriousness! Let me show you. This company has zero turnover, zero income, zero income, zero employees. How did you give the contract to this company? It has zero? Zero, yes. You didn't know?\nWell, how... Let's see, let's ask the secretary, let's see... But you are the mayor, you sign the contracts. If the company is reliable, I don't see why they cannot do the work. Public contracts can be attributed to a private company in two ways: through an auction or through direct acquisition. For the direct acquisition the sum has to be under 100 thousand euros. The advantage is that the public institution can choose which company to work with, without doing any auction. The Gîrliciu council had a plan to build pedestrian walks in the village. Because the sum was over 100 thousand euros and to be sure that the company Hercinic was selected they split the contract in two. You have a contract for pedestrian walks. What is the second contract for? Also for traffic improvements. Why didn't you hold an auction? Because it is not needed and it's following the law. You made this direct acquisition legal by breaking the contract in half. If they are different contracts?! What is the difference? Yes, this is the problem with the sport complex. I was asking about the pedestrian walks. What is the difference between the two projects? The difference between the two projects... Well, if there are two projects for traffic improvements for pedestrian traffic, for... If you had made one project, because in the end both projects are for the same thing, building pedestrian sidewalks you should have made an auction but you divided the project in half meaning you got around the law so that you can directly select the company and I want to ask you what the rationale is behind this decision? Why did you divide the project in two? I think I already said what I had to say. In 200 meters take a right on DJ22B. The division of contracts in parts worth less than 100 thousand euros is a scheme that we can find all over the country. The National Local Development Program made it so that this way of operating multiplies uncontrollably. Ciochina commune, Ialomita county Move it a bit to the left! No, no, just put it on that nail, like that, so it stays on its own. Like that! And more to the left... Further from the wall. Like that! Put it up! Like that! Ciochina commune, Ialomita county The city hall received 400.000 euros from the Development Ministry to modernize the three kindergartens in the commune. Madalin Iscru received all the money through another firm he owned, subscribed, just like Hercinic SRL, to the National Program for Local Development. The work was finalized three months ago, and the results look like this... These taps are new? Yes. New, yes. I have never seen taps that rust in three months. The materials are not good. If I use cleaning solution they turn black. I clean them with alcohol to disinfect them, so that the children don't... but otherwise, no... Yes, here the walls were painted and this wall was made where... What kind of paint is this? Just look here! Yes, indeed, here it is... What kind of paint is this, just look! When spring comes, they will fix all the problems that were... And from those 100,000 euros, didn't you have one euro left to change this? More, there's more left, they have to come and... Yes, like I told you, the contractor was a bit in a hurry and the deal is that, when the weather allows it, they will come and fix everything... And the gentleman is repairing new furniture now? Yes, the furniture, you know, children pull it and automatically... They pull and the hinge breaks... The cabinet that the man from the Ciochina kindergarten is repairing broke quickly but this doesn't mean that it was also cheap. We have obtained the prices charged by the priest's firm for the kindergartens it refurbished. Most of the prices are well above market average. For example, we have found prices for workmanship that were inflated up to nine times. For installing 100 sqm of foor tiles, Iscu asked four times the average market price. For priming he charged seven times more, and for installing one sqm of laminate flooring, he increased the tariff by over 800%. Mr. mayor, with 100.000 euros you could have build a new kindergarten for 60 children from scratch! Yes... This was the situation... In the end, the mayor admits he regrets having awarded the contract to government counselor Madalin Iscu's firm. He says he didn't have a choice. He was told that if he didn't sign with him, he wouldn't get any funds from the ministry. A blackmail to which he gave in for the sake of the children who, otherwise, would have been left without a refurbished kidergarten. Can you please tell us how you found this contractor? Yes... Some...phone calls... \"Someone will come and help you as soon as possible with this rehabilitation project of the kindergartens in your commune.\" Phone calls that came from where? Well, from the top... From the party? From the top. From the governing party? From the governing party? Yes. And what did they tell you on the phone? Well, to solve it as soon as possible, these are trustworthy people and that ... \"you have to refurbish the school units in the commune.\" Only with this firm? Well, they were the ones who came... yes. Were you afraid that you would lose the funds from the Government if you didn't sign with this firm? Well, yes, you can see that everyone accuses us that we aren't capable of drawing funds. And so, wishing not to lose the funds and also to do something we agreed to sign the contract. Madalin Iscru's influence came straight from the Romanian Government. In the autumn of 2018 when he signed the contracts for the modernization of the kindergartens in Ciochina Iscru was a consultant for the ministry of development, which allocated the funds. While he got the money from the ministry of development, the priest was hiding in his public declaration of interest the fact that he was administrator of his company. A mayor that signed contracts with Iscru's company told us anonymously what Iscru was doing at the ministry. He has connections. When we were there the minister was nothing in comparison to him. What? The minister had no influence compared to Iscru! You went together at the ministry? Yes, we went even if we didn't like it and: \"come here and listen to the director on how it should be done\" There were several mayors, he called us and around the copy machines in the hallway he wrote several invoices. He was doing invoices on the ministry hallway. I told him to his face... and i stopped working with him. And I said: \"Do you know what you did? You stole money using our signature!\" We tried to find out from the former vice prime minister if he knew what his consultant was doing and what were the real motives of his employment at the ministry. About your consultant Iscru I want to ask I'm in a hurry, don't you see? I have no time... Why did you bring Mr. Mădălin Iscru in the Ministry? I bring whoever I think I need to bring. Altân Tepe is the only village in Romania where the majority of the residents live in blocks. There are 200 forgotten villagers in these outskirts of the Tulcea County. Their problems are so great that the shortcomings we meet in the majority of settlements throuought the country look even less important here. Oh dear... Can't you see the wilderness around here, the blocks are falling down and nobody cares. This one is cracked, if I hit it, it will fall. Do you hear the sound of it? The whole piece will fall if...  take a look! An earthquake and it will go... Just look... it will fall. They should repair the blocks, paint them, because they are falling apart. There are apartments. In the apartments they chop wood, it's infernal! A lot of the apartments are abandoned and the people that remained transformed them into household annexes. What is here? The bedroom. It was the bedroom, the living room. We bought wood, we don't have central heating, when the mine was still working we had that. Now we don't have it, we made stoves, look at the holes! If you come by the window and see all the chimneys... Altân Tepe belongs to Stejaru council, Tulcea county. The priorities of the local administration have nothing in common with the needs of the people. The mayor Nicolae Gioga has signed a 100 thousand euro contract last year for intelligent public illumination. The winner: Iscru's company. The ministry of development has allocated the money via the national local development programe but nobody from the government has ever calculated how many lamps are needed in Altân Tepe, a village with just a few streets. We verified: This is the 46th lamp. Just 46 lamps were installed for 100 thousand euros. This means 2,173 euros per lamp. A lamp like this you can find on the market for 50 euros. So, they have inflated the prices 40 times. 100.000 euros? God! For 46 lamps? Very interesting! Would have been better with some roofs on the blocks than these lamps. Why did they install lamps? So that we can see what? The ghosts in the empty blocks? Let's be serious, 46 lamps for 100.00 euros. That's what is says at the ministry of development. It's like that? The truth is that on the way to the top a lot of stuff is happening. We are too little for his war. How much money they get from this! We asked the council of Stejaru for documents on how the money was spend for the public illumination. For two weeks there was no answer from the mayor, so we went to search for him at his office. He should come soon, I spoke this morning with him and he said he will come. He will come, yes? Yes! Let's hope he shows up now that the press is here. 30 seconds later He said that he cannot make it. He's in Tulcea at some meeting. He suddenly left to Tulcea? I spoke with him, I told him you came. And the vice mayor? The vice mayor should be around. Yes? Let's find him then. Let me talk to the accountant. Hello! Maybe you can answer our question: How did you end up paying 2.000 euros for a lamp in Altân Tepe? 2.000 euros? Yes. In Altân Tepe? This is not possible! What is going on? The mayor and the vice mayor are no show, they just vanished. The vice-mayor is sick, let's call him. The mayor... should show up today. Mr vice mayor? There are some journalists here. Will you be able to come here? No? See how he's talking? Thinking that we left, the vice-mayor came to the office several hours later. Alex Nedea from Recorder, from Bucharest. You're hiding from us. I have the flu. We wanted to ask how come you paid 2.000 euros for a lamp in Altân Tepe. How did we pay 2.000 euros? How much was the project? How much was it? The led lamps, we installed 500 led lamps. Where? In Altân Tepe? No, in Altân Tepe, Sejaru and Alecsandri. See here, let me show you, there are three different contracts. Modernization of public illumination in Altân Tepe 530.000 RON, is written black on white. Modernization of public illumination in  Alecsandri 530.000 RON. The second time. Modernization of public illumination in  Stejaru. 590.000 RON. We'll send you an address tomorrow and... How do you explain that there are three different contracts? You will find out tomorrow, I told you I was sick. In the next days we sent 20 questions to 20 councils from Tulcea, Constanța, Brăila, Buzău, Vrancea and Mureș. We asked for documents to justify what has the consultant  Iscru done for the money he received from the ministy of development. We got no answers. Pray to the lord We go back to the church from Sâmbăta Nouă to find the answers from the source. We are inviting you to lunch and then we can talk. We don't want to eat, we're waiting for you. Just two minutes. We can even 20 but let's sit at the table like civilized people and after that we can talk, no problem. So we need to wait for you to finish the service. This is the way, we cannot break the way... Ok, we're waiting for you. I invite you over to lunch, if you want ok, if not... Thank you for your invitation, we will be waiting for you. 10 minutes later Yes, mister Nedea, unfortunately, I invited you to lunch, if you don't want to come, I'm very sorry but... I just want to ask you... I cannot answer any questions depending on your actions... I will answer some other time, yes? I want to ask you how is it possible to take a ghost company and right away win contract after contract with public authorities. It is your opinion, we have nothing to... We'll talk some other time. Is an incredible miracle. God makes miracles. That's why we serve Him because he loves us and makes miracles. This is your only explanation? The national local development program: this program is the largest project of local development since the revolution the bravest one, the most complex. Today we have PNDL 2, the program whose chances of development of a lot of local communities depend on. With the help of these program we pulled the nation from the mud. These are the ways to cheat, cheating the PSD way. This is how PSD does, a pencil costs 1 RON, they buy it with 70 or 80 RON! This is PSD! This is Romania. All the leaders since the 89 revolution have only though about stealing. Taking by force and stealing. Stealing...      "}

Yes, if Trump comes to drink a beer with me, I will tell him: “Take a seat, I’ll buy the beer, no worries.“ Yes? Bucharest, eight months ago I’m buying for Mr Dragnea… In case you didn’t know. In Mai 2018, Bogdan Lungu, a taxi driver from Galați, lost a bet on Facebook with Liviu Dragnea and as result was bringing him a case of beer at the Social Democratic Party headquarters in Bucharest. Hello! Are you the one who lost the bet? I think so, hello. Did you bring the beer? No! What do you think? A full case, right? Like I promised. Well, Ursus? Is the leader of the biggest party going to drink… Ursus? What is this? Bogdan Lungu and Liviu Dragnea spoke for an hour about politics and life After the discussion with Liviu Dragnea, Bogdan Lungu made an important decision: I told him: I’m going to leave the country. He said he hopes I will change my mind. I said I will not change my mind. I will leave the country. And I will take my family as well. It’s not like I’m leaving for a day and then come back tomorrow. I’ll take my family and emigrate. He said, “I’m sorry!\" I am the one who's sorry! I do not have a future in Romania. My children have no future in Romania. The man with the beer case moves on How did you feel after talking with Mr Dragnea? Betrayed, lied to. I got home and spoke to my wife about what our next move is. I told her what I spoke about with him and the conclusion I reached: That he is pretty far off from the truth And that the future of our children will not be too great In the next 20 years. Not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, in the next 20 years. And getting home and thinking about it more overnight, My wife and I decided to leave the country for good. We’re not going to leave for a month, for two months, to earn some money and then buy an apartment here… No. We will not be back in the country except as visitors. The country is very beautiful, but its leaders are below any expectations. Did you change your view on him? No, in no way. And he can’t convince you to do that? It’s his duty to try and mine to not accept this. Yes! That’s right! And are you trying mister president? To change the public perception... A single meeting is not enough. Should we bet on the highways? Until the end of my term? Until 2020! We can bet on a beer case that you will not build more than 150 kilometres given in use. I think we will. I don’t know what you think, I’m betting that until 2020… Take me slowly! Iohannis (Romania’s president) scolds me enough. After this, you will scold Iohannis. I’m not here to scold you. I’m telling you we will do more than that. On a case of beer! I was undecided whether or not to emigrate  before the meeting with mister Dragnea, Even though I had a lot of opportunities. As a sailor, I had the opportunity to see a lot of countries, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) didn’t pay me. I was a sailor and I travelled. That’s why you see on my social media that I’ve been to Poland, to Norway, that I reached the North Pole. It’s because I was a sailor, it’s easy. I had to opportunity to stay in any of those countries in Europe, but I always said it’s better home. It’s harder, we’ll see how we’ll get by. But after Dragnea, who, by the way, rules over Romania at the moment, Tells me that Europe has something against us and that he mostly cares about justice And that millions of Romanians are under surveillance. And I asked him who these millions of Romanians are? Because in the country, there are 18 million left, Out of 18 million, one, two are children. That’s 16 left. Then there’s one, two million powerless, old people, that’s 14 left. Who are these millions of people that you keep saying are surveilled by the SRI? And on whose behalf do you fight with the justice department and with the opposition party? I don’t have anything else to say to Mr Dragnea. What else could I say? That hour and a half we spoke without the press were enough for me. What message could I have for mister Liviu Dragnea? I don’t have any message. Except for this: carry out. His jail sentence is not big, just do it! Carry it out. For 2019, Bogdan Lungu’s goal is to become an American citizen and bring his family there with him. I already started the paperwork so I can become a citizen, I will do the same for my family. Documents, forms, blah, blah. It will be hard and it will take some time. Americans aren’t really like: you come to their country and that’s it. They’re not waiting for you, you’re the one who goes to them. But there is no reason to hurry up. We’re not in a hurry. We want to stay here. It’s good for us here. Here things function normally. I’m not thinking about whether I will eat something tomorrow, No way. I never felt so at home like I feel in New York. A lot of people, they smile, everyone minds their own business. Work is work and beer is beer. You don’t mix that up here. Not like in Romania where at lunchtime you’re going for a beer and eventually a nap. That doesn’t work here. If you aren’t serious, you won’t survive. It's not like home where we pretend we work and they pretend they pay us. They don’t have time here to convince you to be serious. Once you saw a subway functioning properly, A workplace that is paid appropriately, Once you see civilized people on the street, Once you see how a hospital should look like, Once you see a child who is properly taken care of and you don’t see… poverty, You’re not coming back."}

A ajuns la orfelinatul de la Plătărești (la 20 de kilometri distanță de Capitală) și a constatat că, după toate ororile pe care le văzuse ca polițist, încă mai existau lucruri care puteau să-l înspăimânte.

Bucharest so you've got to remember in those days there's no advertising says no neon lights street lights on the main roads with no street lights on the side streets no shops as such you had to go to the market places to buy your food there were some tailor shops I remember it'd be cactus plants in the windows every shop seem to have cactus plants for some reason or other but just a lack of color my first contact with Romania came through television coverage of the state of orphanages so-called so we drove over here in a van for the medical aid baby food all those sort of things and literally drove across Europe and not knowing what to expect or whatever there was a big difference in attitude when you go into the Hungarian side when you got on to the Romanian side it was completely different hiring it's just extraordinary and we are was asked for a stamp ela never use stamps in in England why would I need a stamp and apparently I had to make a list of all the things that were in the vehicle and stabbed it to make it official I don't have a staff oh no no no then you can't come in but this is you know for the children sort oh no you can't come in no without stamp so I actually use a 10-10 penny or ten pence coin and I read from my borrow at the top of it to get the impression of this round stamp on this piece of paper with the Queen's Head on it and they must have thought it was really official so they allowed us in graciously but we did have to part with a couple of packets of cigarettes as we normally did when we went over the border [Music] I think the first thing probably was the smell so it was a smell of excrement and vomit permutated everywhere then there was the rocking the children rocking back and forth in a in their cots almost as if they had they were in the arms of imaginary mummies you know and then the screaming just children screaming just for screaming sake and other children just talking to an imaginary person so I nothing I had ever done in my whole life actually prepared me for that moment it was hard very very hard [Music] I worked in a room with 20 children so they were aged between 8 and 9 they were all still being bottle-fed none of them had left their cots from all because I'm they were cop and they couldn't walk some were able to sit up some just later aimlessly you had one Kara for 20 children carmen was a girl in my room and she just looked like an 80 year old woman in a child's body full of wrinkles and she died in the second week we were there so I was working in this place for one month so she was the first child to die and then I was dead Balu who always laid on his front he never turned over until the milk came I mean the woman used to come along with metal buckets with the milk bottles in there and as soon as the children heard that they rolled over sat up waiting for their bottle of milk but because the cots was so tight together what was happening was the stronger children were finishing their milk and then grabbing the bottle of milk from their next-door neighbor and drinking that as well so the ones who were quite weak got even weaker I just couldn't imagine how anyone could actually treat or not treat children in a non caring environment I just that the fact that they were just looking after basic needs was just completely alien to me so we made a decision much against the directors will to wienies children these 20 children in my room and we did successfully we've got the month because we had baby food we brought over a lot of baby food so once we had started feeding the children the diarrhea stopped they became stronger and this is in the matter of days you saw these changes taking place within the month we had all the children pretty well up and walking by that stage and of course once we took them out the COTS that was that was an awful experience as well because they were being taken out the security the only security the only place they had ever known and you were physically removing them from that environment into something which is unknown to them and they screamed uncontrollably I mean they felt really really threatened and all we were doing was taken up from the cot but to put them on the floor so they can interact with the the other children in the room and we took them out for the first time ever they'd never ever been outside Florentina was a little Roma girl with beautiful black curly hair but she was almost blind by that stage so when we took her outside I had her in my arms and she started touching the leaves on the trees on the bushes and everything had to go on the lips just like a newborn baby touches everything on that it's so Florentino do with everything because she came in contact with I was just extraordinary you could see just the change in these children to be outside and in the sunlight I mean it was just extraordinary and once the children found their legs and started being able to walk they just became little explorers all they want to do is explore the environment in which they lived in and so that meant leaving the room that they had been confined to certainly leaving the COTS I mean the transformation was incredulous absolutely incredulous I didn't believe that such a change could happen to a small number of children who who've been deprived of pretty well everything love affection stimulation to be able to respond so quickly and these were a work you pible so if we could do that for 20 children in one month you can imagine why I came back [Music] my first marriage broke down I lost my oldest son in a car accident before I came here just before I came here so in many respects looking back now it's easy to see the year of cows running away personally from all the things that were troubling me back in the UK and trying to find this person who didn't exist anymore I mean my first part of my life was was over and I I had no idea what the next part of my life was going to be like I had absolutely no idea so maybe it is not unusual that I could adjust so well to living in a ghetto in some woods because there was nothing else really disappear of it I was here I had to do something with my life I had to make it work and I then moved into Farrington I mean this disused block ghetto and and I just immersed myself into the local area I used to go to the bars with the local Roma booster beers and whatever and I just totally immersed myself in the community which was the only way I think I could have coped I mean okay I was referred to locally as in Glaser ordinay bun the crazy English person you know crazy Englishman but I never saw myself as an oddity I mean I just didn't never crossed my mind that this was a really strange thing to do but I mean I look back now and go wow I mean I mean it was a police no-go area and the police wouldn't go anywhere near it no taxis would come anywhere near it so we had to do a lot of walking to get in and out of the place but no I mean I was treated with the greatest of respect I'm I got invited to baptisms and weddings and so on and so I was very much part of the community they never physically abused me at all or verbally they were try and steal fine but I mean they they treated me well absolutely so well [Music] at that time that demographic of homelessness was older men 50-plus we've been living on the streets and what we would describe as chronic homeless they were there until they died went to various places like garden or the parks and started talking with homeless people but and we started talking with them gaining their trust abused abandoned coffee and cigarettes new health and we talked about night shelters and I said okay so tell me what a night shelter is and I'll build you one and they said no you the expert you tell us what a night shelter is I said actually I'm not the expert here because I know nothing about homelessness or anything else all night shelters but you the experts because you've got lived experience of being homeless so all we're going to do is answer your needs so you tell me what you need and we build a night shelter based on those needs and you've got to remember back in those days I mean Google had only just started so the internet was just in its infancy so it wasn't as if you could go and Google what's a night shelter and and have all this information and all this experience we had nothing there was nothing we had to start from scratch the municipality gave us a building in Bucharest kenoyer former fruit and vegetable shop but quite a large one and they moved in where we cleaned it up would be painted and decorated it because some furniture together and it was in the space of two or three weeks we transformed this building into an actual fact and I said to them this is your night shelter it is your responsibility I can pay the bills but you have to look after so I was not out I was never there outside them all working out so when it was 9:00 to 5:00 on what I would focus on see you later guys and it was just it was just amazing that they took took on the role of looking after this place and treated it like their home and I mean that the first morning I got there and there's the guy he was crying and I tried to comfort him and he said no no you got it all wrong he said I'm not crying because I'm sad I said I'm crying because I'm overjoyed this is the first time I've been in a bed in five and a half years Wow that's powerful that's really really powerful another guy met ray and I said asked him how he has slept and he said sleep you've got to be joking I'll never be more comfortable comfortable in my life if you think I was going to waste that sleep here this is crazy and these are guys who were alcoholic who were bums living on the street and they totally transformed themselves and I thought okay I'm kind of liking this working with homeless people so [Music] [Applause] so we opened in the winter of 97 98 and in November 9 th Prince Charles officially opened the night shelter and that was an amazing moment as well as he should have spent 40 minutes with us he spent about an hour and a half all together with us king Mihai also visited the Queen Anna and on that particular occasion it was the first time that King Mihai was allowed back into the country I was talking to him and said actually you know I have a night shelter for all the homeless men would you come visit and he said yes I would I'd like to very much so within a week or two he was there and he arrived and we had a woman there as well and she was blind and she used to crochet little woolen baskets and she put in this little basket bread and salt and the king just looked at her healthy stuff basket and whipped the person who actually welcomed him in the traditional way was a little blind homeless woman he's just just extraordinary romanian men tend to be macho men the world revolves around them we have one case for a woman from the countryside was actually chained naked to a tractor in the front garden by a husband as a form of punishment I mean it's just it's just awful I mean just absolutely awful these women are broken I mean a emotionally broken they are physically exhausted I mean you can try and imagine a situation where you're living with somebody who's abusive you're living at your wits end because no matter what you do you have to try so hard not to upset this person because you're gonna get beaten I mean I've heard so often from from survivors of domestic abuse they put up with it because they thought it was normal part of marriage because their mothers had told them okay sometimes these things happen so it's part of being married [Music] it's my hope I mean it's I've never lived in one place as long as I have here 28 years so in many respects it's also the country of my rebirth because it's where I discovered who I really was and I liked very much who I've become so and you know my second wife is is Romanian I'm a Romanian family I'm more Romanian friends and I have foreign friends so no I mean it's it's my country I have the right to demonstrate and protest against the government if I see it as corrupt and I take that position very seriously I mean I don't want corrupt politicians and I'll stand down in ghetto universidade or Victoria or whatever are the theatres and shout my mouth because I think it's wrong deserves to be said and if more of us did it and I think we could affect change so yeah exactly the citement too right I hope not [Music]"}

Stop pushing! I'm in! They humiliated us. A mockery. That cathedral, what is it made out of? It is still made from our own backs! Romanian People's Humiliation Cathedral First buses arrive in the centre of Bucharest - Good morning, welcome. The volunteers, right?\n- Yes, yes. - Tell me, where are you from? \n- From the diocese of Buzau and Vrancea. People from all over the country come to participate at the sanctification of the cathedral. From Huşi? Welcome! We need to move quickly because there are others coming! The first-comers have the privilege to enter the cathedral's courtyard. - If you want in front...\n...but here is not wet and you have the whole perspective. Hundreds of buses occupy the boulevards near the cathedral. After a whole night's journey, the people are tired, but enthusiastic. - For these things, there is no 'being tired'. - God is with us. - Good thoughts! We're here to see it, to listen to the service... - So we don't die stupid.... - To health...\n- Let there be peace in our country... - I came all the way from England, from Northampton! - We've been preparing for a month, and with the help of God we are now here! - In pairs, or in threes. One behind another. - Like in school. - Dana Paraschiv is here... - George Patrascu is here... - Margareta Vladila...I haven't seen her.\n- She's here. - Where is she I can't see her.\n- There in the back.\n- Okay I see her now. Two, five, seven... Ten, twelve, fifteen. Eighteen, twenty...four and that's it. Wait, wait, wait. \nSomeone is back. Aaaah...I think this is going to be a very long day... - Come quicker, man.\nCome already! Will is not enough: Some realised the trip is too much for them... - What are you doing? Did you get lost from your group? - Noo, I was left behind. They were going like they were riding horses! - Ah, and you are taking it slow... - I'm going back to the bus...\nI can't keep up... - But you're going to miss the service...\n- What?\n- You're missing the service. - Well what can I do if I can't keep up...they were going too fast. - I can't. - What are you expecting to see?\n- The patriarch, the beautiful service... - The beautiful people, the pious... The high priests had an easier night. They spent the night at a 5 star hotel, situated right across the cathedral. The high priests exit to welcome the patriarch. - Are you going to move out of the way? The special guests arrive at the cathedral. - No one did anything for the centenary! \nThis cathedral was built! - It's Romania's greatest realisation of the past 100 years. - Did you personally contribute to the financing? - I gave 2 million euros in the beginning, when they didn't even have the project. - Good morning. It is a national event, the People's Cathedral, Romania's Cathedral in the year of the centenary... ...and year precursor to Romania's National Day. - What does the accomplishment of this project mean for you? - The accomplishment of Romanians! And that of Romania! - A project, a monument, that we can be proud of. - And I think that this pride should not only belong to me, as the prime minister... ...every Romanian should carry this pride in their hearts. A lot of people are wondering when proper investments will be made in hospitals... - This is a special moment, let us only talk about this event. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people were left behind the cathedral's fences. - We are being treated like cattle! I came here for the service, not to stand behind bars... Because the cathedral is still under construction, only a couple thousand people fit in the courtyard. - Now we start, God's help, the holy and divine liturgy. The first one in this national cathedral. And we are honoured by your presence. - Please, from the bottom of my heart, please understand this one thing. The priests are already in. It's just me and two people, that's it... Bless you. Alright, where is...where is Simona? They let them in because they know someone? How is this even possible? We are in a church! They don't want to let us in. That side is blocked, this side... How is this allowed?\nThis is the Romanian! The people were advised to peacefully watch the service on the screens in front of the cathedral. This is our spot where we will stand and watch the sanctification on the screens. We, the old ones, can't hear that well. We hear it, but with interruptions. - It's the cloud above the church. Under the shape of a cloud it came, above the church... - What does that mean? - This means the Holy Spirit. - Hello! Can you see anything from there?\n- Well no, because the fence is boarded up! - You can't see anything, mister, can't you see? There's ten thousand people... - We came here to see, but we can only see the fence. - Where did you come from?\n- From Saint George, Covasna. - Took me four hours, from five to nine, now here... - At least if they had a bigger screen, and move it up so so people can see...but this? - You have to climb the fence to see the screen... - I understand that inside...they already have guests, 2500 now. - They, if they had an invitation, what do I know? - They are another social class, you know... After a service that lasted five hours, the patriarch enters the limousine to go 50 meters to the luxury hotel. If the patriarch would be this country's prime minister, and he had a free hand like he does now... ...we would see more accomplishments. Stay in your places! Seeing that the service is over, the people ran out of patience and wanted to get inside the church. - Stop pushing!\n- The ones from Ramnicu Sarat, pay attention, he went to talk to someone, yes? - So, we have our own sector, we were brought by the diocese. - We didn't come by ourselves, we need to enter!\n- Normal! - Brought, organised, with buses, everything by the diocese. - Father, this is what is happening: right now, as you can see, we are letting people in progressively. Easy! Stop pushing! Easy, please! Stop pushing! Stop pushing, please! That's it! Easy, easy! I stood here to come in God's House, but I have problems with my heart, and when they pushed me I nearly fainted! Look who's pushing! From there! Drag it a bit to the side, it's killing me! Stop pushing, there are elderly women here! Watch your feet! What a chaos, they're breaking our backs with the fences, hitting us? It's not nice! You come to the church or what? We weren't going to get out, and they almost broke our feet! Well, if the bodyguard wouldn't have opened up the fence, I would've been in the hospital. Honestly, in the hospital! Stop looking at me, my back is hurting! I know, I know... Only the people in the front were able to get into the cathedral. God bless, my dears! We have a great joy! People are already going through the Holy Altar at the National Cathedral. People are praying to the relics of Saint Apostol Andrew and it is great joy! For the first time we see the line of people... ...and the beautiful door of the National Cathedral, absolutely remarkable... ...superb marble. We thank the Lord for this! It has been a busy day! From seven in the morning until three in the afternoon we stood in the cold...but it was worth it. Though the bodies are cold, the hearts are burning! We praise the Lord for this! Joy! From the National Cathedral! We ask you very kindly to speed up exiting the cathedral! If you entered through the Holy Altar, please, do not block the exiting corridor. Yes, but you can't do anything... Many couldn't wait until access was permitted in the cathedral. We made it until the fence when the people from the buses called us and said we need to leave and... We couldn't enter at all because of the crowd and the bus is leaving... God, they brought us for nothing! Didn't you see the altar? I didn't see anything, I didn't go in! Were you able to see the inside? No and we are gone from three in the morning, from Galati! Yes! How was it? Very bad! We stood at the gates just like cattle! Bad! I was freezing there, son! They kept us like... - Shut up, you!\n- Come on, the Father will be upset! - Oh, it's nothing - it was great!\n- It was beautiful! Very beautiful! Don't take any more interviews, we really didn't like what you organised for us! Like animals they kept us there! They didn't let us go forwards, didn't let us go backwards! Stop filming us, we're upset! - Miss, did you enter?\n- I didn't enter, my bag is broken, how can I go in? I can't wait to get to the train station. - Where did you come from?\n- From Bistrita-Nasaud, they almost killed me in there! God forbid! This, I have never seen in my life! Is the metro close? - Did you lose your group?\n- Yes, the whole group. - Are you alone here?\n- Alone, yes. - Can you remember where they parked?\n- I can't remember... - Don't you have a phone or something?\n- I don't have the right number... After being cold and disappointed, the people from the provinces were confused by the immensity of the city. We can't find the bus! It's got to be somewhere here. Are you on the right, where the fir tree is? Where? Which gate? Why would I go there? I'm going to the bus, your problem! I can't see any of them. It's the ones from Stoile... While the High Priests were enjoying their feast at Marriott, the rest of the priests were left to find their parishioners. If I make another one, I'm done! \nAre you near the fir tree? Can you hear me? I am Father Dima, I was with you on the bus. Where are you? Hello? Oh, I was calling her? Did I just call you? Forget about it, mistake. Leave her alone! Six, seven... Stop taking pictures, you're taking them for nothing! They mocked us and we didn't see anything! - You're right!\n- Isn't that so? We stood like cattle. They didn't even open up the nets from the fence so we can see something! We stood like idiots! They mocked us! A mockery! That cathedral, what is it made out of? It is still made from our own backs! No one makes anything unless it's from our own backs! - Didn't see anything. Did you see anything?\n- No!\n- I also didn't see anything! A mockery! We are the old ones, but these small children? What are they doing? Are they mocking them as well? It's fine, God will see every one of them, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Our hopes are with him!  "}

Am petrecut câteva zile alături de Sagar și Ramesh, doi tineri veniți din Nepal în urmă cu aproape un an, și am înțeles că motivele pentru care și-au lăsat în urmă casa și familia nu difera cu nimic de cele ale milioanelor de români plecați la muncă prin Europa.\n\nArticolul complet este aici: https://bit.ly/2RsnAEJ\n\nRecorder este o publicație online construită de o echipă de jurnaliști în jurul acestor principii: jurnalism onest, făcut cu pasiune și pus în serviciul public.

Here you go.\nThanks! Good afternoon! Warm still water? Yes. Here and there. I'm Sagar Chhetri. I'm 30 years old. I'm from Nepal, and I work in the salon,\n as a waiter assistant. And I want to make my future better. That is why chose to come to Romania for work. When I go to clients I say \n“buna ziua!” (good afternoon Ed.), “Buna dimineata!” (good morning Ed.)\nor “buna seara!” (good evening Ed.) That's when the client figures out from my accent,\n I'm not from Romaina. And they ask where am I from. And I reply Nepal. They say“Frumos”. (lovely Ed.)\n And I say “mulțumesc!” (thank you Ed.) Are you good? What's going on? My name is Ramesh Shrestha and I work in the kitchen. I would watch movies and TV shows \nwith chefs, and how they work. I used to help my mom as well when I was a kid. So I said it's OK to go to Romania. It's a european county, and its beautiful to learn different cuisines as well. So I decided to come here\n and the experience is good for me. People react differently, \nsome in a bad way, and some good. Normally they see us Nepalese \nfor the first time where I work. Some people welcome us \nvery warmly, and some are rude. But it's OK because it's human nature, I expect that. Even I do the same with new people... I think. Sagar and Ramesh are two of the hundreds\n of Nepalese workers already in Romania The Romanian labor force crisis obliges native companies to bring employees from the Asian region The Romanian citzen is not available for work. Both physically and willing to work. But we are talking first of all physically. They're aren't any Romanian citizens who want to work. While non-European Union citizens exists. It's very simple why we choose\n non-european union citizens. The only difference between a Romanian and a Nepalese is that we speak a different language, but in the time they have accommodated here. One of them even works in the salon. They started speaking very well Romanian, \nand work just a good as a Romanian would. Obviously, there is a different attitude to work \nbecause they send 100 euros a month back home, from which a family has to live on,\n and start building a home. For them, money has different value other than for a Romanian for whom 100 euros does not support a family \nand start to building a new home. If we remember, in '90, in '92 -'93, when a Romanian would send home \n100 German marks after working in Germany, he could support a whole family with\n 100 marks and start building a house. Basically, Nepal is like Romania 30 years ago, \nas was Italy 80 years ago. These people came here to work, to suppot their family. They came to do a good thing. They didn't come here to wrong anyone. Nepal has a population of 29 million inhabitants \nand a GDP 13 times smaller than Romania Sagar and Ramesh have been in Romania for about a year and have become accustomed to life here Hello! Good afternoon! Do you live on the ninth floor? Yes, on the ninth. Stop leaving the elevator door open in the mornings. I wake up at 4 and the door is opened. It was somebody else, not me. They leave at 11... I don't know. The door is open at 4 in the morning. I didn't come home at 4, it had to be somebody else. What? It had to be somebody else at 4:30. No sir! I leave at 4:30... No, the boys said that at that hour they don't leave. Well they don't, but I do. It shows thats the door is open on the ninth... It wasn't us, excuse us. See what the situation is. Yeah, thanks. They live with three other Nepalese co-workers,\nin an apartment in Militari, rented by their employers They all work in the same restaurant in Bucharest and,\nat the end of the month, send home most of their salary I keep for myself a little bit, \nand the rest I send to my family. Almost 70% I send back home to them. Yeah, 25% I use, 25% they use,\n 50% they will keep for the future. In Nepal they have the same problem as Romania, that's why our youth keeps leaving abroad.\n And we can't get a good job back home. Even if we get a good job, the salary isn't perfect for living paycheck to paycheck. That is why many people leave abroad. If I get a government job it would be around \n800-900 ron (175-190 euro Ed.) a month. Besides this there are other jobs as well. Even if we work in the restaurant there,\nthere is no salary. You work for food only. On their free days, they cook traditional Nepalese \nfood and talk on their phone with friends and family It's a spice. Chilly pepper. We like eating spicy food. It's my wife. Hello... This is how you say bon appetit,\n this is the closest translation. My wife called me and she said, she misses me. What can I do? I don't have a different option. I'm here I know, but I miss spending time with her. She calls me always, especially when I'm free at home. In fact, she was recently in my hometown, \nwhich is her hometown. When I was home, I used to ride it all over the bike.\n Now she has to take the bus. It makes me feel bad, because she is alone there. Soon hopefully, we will be together again. That is what I miss the most... First, I miss my daughter, my family and my friends. I have one daughter. She is 20 months now. When I see other children in the restaurant I feel like calling them, but because I'm at work I can't. I left so she could have a better future. I want my daughter to study well,\n so she will remain in our country. So we don't have to keep going abroad. That's what I want, and why\n I keep working here on my own."}

In the Hospital? I worked for 24 years... We had good times, bad times, all mixed Sometimes with yelling at each other, with shortages or running around We went through the \"Colective\" Club fire tragedy... A thing like that will scar you for life... When you perform a resuscitation maneuver On a burned child and his thorax cracks like a cartboard box Mariana Luceanu worked for 24 years as a nurse at the Anaesthesiology Department of the Bucharest Emergency University Hospital At the end of last week, she was fired by the hospital manager The official reason: \"Absence from work\" I was fired for absence. But I missed work because I was out telling everyone from Romania the conditions in this Hospital. The real reason: Mariana opposed the system, she went for several days on hunger strike and spoke with the press about the bad conditions in the hospital. This can't be true... When the Colective fire happened... In my career I saw all sorts of tragedies. I saw people hit by the train, I saw others ran over by garbage trucks I saw multiple injuries after a tram accident, I saw... too much. I saw a lot... When I saw what happened at Colective, I said to myself: I haven't seen anything until now. So I asked myself what is actually happening Everyone was saying: \"We are fully prepared for everything!\". But, in reality, we had nothing...   Nothing... we were improvising... running around,  borrowing from other sections of hospital It was a total chaos. And in our hospital, the aftermath of the Colective fire lasted for two weeks. And I said to myself: I find myself in this swamp Until it will swallow me completely. I will suffocate in this filthy swamp and I lived for nothing on this Earth, I done nothing to stop it. I said: this can't be possible. So I started to talk. In the last 2 years, Mariana got into arguments with the hospital management, after she made public the bad work conditions in the institution. You can't deny it, because I filmed here yesterday... Please, Sir, keep your hands to yourself! I started to talk At that time, the operating room was cleaned with dishwashing detergent. And there are videos to prove that. Videos that I personally filmed. I could hear my colleagues complaining:\nWe have no Betadyne! We don't have that, we don't have this... One day, the Head Nurse tells me : You need to cut down on using single use medical supplies. Me working as a anesthesiologist nurse. You want me to do what?! \"Cut down on using medical supplies\" -Who are you asking to do this kind of thing?  You are asking me? -On what could I \"cut down\", if the supplies for the patients in the OR are single use only? More recent issues: the lack of staff... - and they afford to fire me - the lack of medical supplies... the \"totalitarian\" management... From 2017, the hospital is run by Adriana Nica, Sorin Oprescu's partner (the former manager of the institution). It's hard to believe that she got this position for merit, at just 40 years old -  forgive me for saying! anyone knows that everything is political. Let's stop pretending... the medical system has always been the \"honey pot\" of politics. This is where they got their money for elections, political campaigns This is where they got money for... ... and it got where it got... And we, the medical staff, allowed it. We said: just let it go, it's going fine. We let politicians decide for us and we said: let's just see where it goes. maybe something will change in this country Maybe tomorrow something will change No. Nothing has changed Mariana Luceanu was fired after being part of a corrupt medical system that she knew in the smallest details What could I do ? I tried, I was yelling all the time: \"Man, why do you allow the patients to do this?!\" I was being handed envelopes from the patients with tens of millions lei  (bribes - n.r.) and I passed them to my colleagues after the operation, with a legal note and I was yelling at my colleagues: You idiots! Stop allowing the patients to do something like this... Do something about it! \"Eh, who asked you?\" \"I will not take responsibility for any of this, stop this!\" You did not feel tempted to take a bribe? (reporter asked) Sincerely, if  the doctor that I was working with that day came to me and gave me 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 lei - whatever he gave me - I would just say \"Thanks\" and take it. But do you know why I would do that? Because I was the one who worked hard that day, not him! When the patients were coming with bribes, that was not for us, the \"lower class\". The envelopes were for the doctors, the bribes came from top to bottom. And you saw in a corner of the envelope the letter 'A' - that was the money for the  anesthesiologists - in another corner of the envelope it said 'M1' 'First hand' (first surgical team) M2 \"Second Hand\" (second team of surgeons) and 'R' was for the resident physician. The surgical team! Mariana Luceanu's protest is supported by most of her colleagues at the hospital, but the majority choose not to speak up . The colleagues - most of them - were on my part. -But, look, that they are not out protesting with you. (reporter) Because when they tried to join me in the first days of the protest, - and 2 thirds of the Anesthesia Unit protested - the next day, their names were put on the list (list to be fired). So, at the corners, through doctors they got the message ''We have lots of residents we don't need you to work here, we employ new people '' It's not fear. It's the cowardliness\nof the Romanians... ''Why get involed, she's crazy'' ''If there is something in it for me after her actions, fine'' Yeah, I am \"crazy\"! If you are not with them, deep in their swamp They will say someone is paying you to do this thing And they think you do it for lots of money. or someone important is behind you, that controls you to protest or you're  crazy We are silent today, we are silent tomorrow, but our kids will follow. And instead of growing beautiful, honest, open minded kids We keep them captive in the same communism where we lived as kids I cried today, but not because I got fired... For the disappointment I feel in my heart. Was it worth it? It was worth it because now I can look into my children's eyes and say: I wasn't like them!"}

Very well, no problem!\" \"Is he healthy? Yes? Perfect!\" \"Does he have a partner?\" \"Yes.\" \"Very well. But it will be very hard for him.\" He didn't say \"It will be hard for you.\" \"It will be hard for him.\" I said: \"I support him.\" \"Then, maybe it will be easier for him.\" And that was it. But he said: \"You know, you should never attempt to... ...intervene, or to try to... Do not ever attempt to do this!\" \"Just think that it's not easy for him, it's not easy!\" \"You should know this.\" Huh. Those... ...three or four years had passed until...   On a subject that was more concrete, him having a partner and... I could only ask this much: I said: \"Do you love him and does he love you back?\" \"Yes, father.\"\n\"Are you happy?\" \"I am very happy\" \"My dear...\" ...this is what matters the most.\" Until then it was tormenting me. How should I do it? How will our talk be? What should I understand from this? What follows? What are the consequences? In these early phases I always used a reasoning that   lead me towards \"you must\". Not towards what you feel, but towards what you must do, which makes you impose yourself some.. But it is an unfullfilment. Yes, it is an unfullfilment. It is an unfullfilment known that... ...you are Coman, he is a boy... And pow! It ends. If he is... if he is a homosexual, so I won't have a daughter in law, I won't have nephews...   I haven't spoken about this with Relu. He found out now, with the interview from 2016...   ...and in parallel he told me last year, when we met...   ...that: \"Father... I did not realize that... ...you, as a parents... I did not try to put myself in your shoes...   ...but now I'm trying to understand.\" \"You did a great effort.\"   The effort was great for four, five years. After I started, and let me tell you, that was the moment of complete liberation for me, it was when... I broke the link with sexuality.   That is when I felt completely free.   I was saying that these matters on sexuality... ...these are not up for discussion. Not even in our world. Now even me with... You often don't even discuss these matters with your own wife. And let's not get into parents telling their children:   \"you've got that boyfriend... ...but why don't you choose that one?\"   No! You just do do this, you don't enter (n.r. one's private life) This is it. Period. If you don't enter, don't even... imagine all sorts of... ...frightening images: \"My God, how does he do it?\" Let me tell you: This is the biggest mistake. And subsequently I realized that I was perfectly right when I just broke the link with sexuality.   And the moment when I freed myself from this burden of interpretations...   which only ever led to... which only ever led to... the aspect of sexuality... \"How do two boys have sex? How do two women have sex?\"   Mister... (n.r. Romanian for \"My friend\") ...it's not easy. It's not easy to remove sexual thoughts from the mind of a heterosexual, while they... they've got... other relationship dynamics. For them, affection matters very, very much.   The way that they share their lives, free time, knowledge. Liviu Coman lives in the village of Orlești (Vâlcea  County) and he felt the tensions created by the referendum for family inside rural communities. We've had it right here. The priest in the village, Sâia...   It was a quite long exchange of...   ideas. But... No matter how much I strive towards accepting or at least towards toning down the opposition, or.. toning down the acid (n.r. discourse)... No, no, no I can understand...   not enouraging... homosexual marriage. Because marriage, in the Church's acceptance... ...(actually done in the civil institution)...   is, in fact, the link made by God for a family. I can understand this. I can understand. But you should limit yourself to that. Understood?   Yes, I can understand that. But spreading fear and...   ...launching apocalyptic scenarios... ...launching apocalyptic scenarios... \"We promote the traditional family!\" Very well! This is what I have as well. But what should we do with those that.. ...are grown in heterosexual families... ...and turn out homosexual? What do we do to them? Should we educate them? How could you ever change their... keys? (n.r. toy soldier keys) The one that they were born with. What do you want to do with them? Relu Adrian Coman, son of Liviu Coman, lives in New York together with his husband, Clai Hamilton, which he married in 2010.   With the help of Clai I discovered things about Relu... that I did not know about.   And... Our last, let's say... meeting, between me and Relu, took place last year. He booked a cruise and for one week we stayed together and we talked all sorts of things. Like two boys. Without any... father-son relationship constraints. Like two friends. Do you feel loved? Do you love someone? Are you happy? I wish you all the good and I will be there for you. He is my child and... when your child comes and tells you: \"Father, I met a girl... she is poor, but... She is beautiful and kind and she cares for me... And she laughs, she's cheerful and she's had a hard time in her youth... She's put all her faith in me And she's happy with me and I feel that I love her.\" That is where you stop. That is where you stop. At love."}

De aceea am făcut efortul de a merge pe urmele sale.", "transcript": "Odobești village, Dâmbovița County\n27th September, 2018 Social democrat leaders of Dâmbovița  held an information session for the villagers. The topic: how the citizens of Odobești will vote at the next referendum set to block same-sex marriages. Wait a minute! Kiss me here! Right here... The priest and the mayor gathered the villagers at the community center. We gathered today in order to inform the people about the referendum that will take place on the 6th and 7th of October, Because many have no idea what's they are voting for. Some old lady told me a few days ago: Mayor, I will come and vote for you on the 6th this month. I told her that there's no election day.   \n           The people are poorly informed. And it's good to be informed. Titus Corlățean\nSocial Democrat senator representing Dâmbovița County Hello! Hello, mr. mayor! Dâmbovița is the county that gathered the most signatures on the petition for legislating only heterosexual marriages, 155.000 One out of three citizens                                                                     from Dâmbovița have signed the petition. So, you saw the flowers, right? We can put them away now... Testing... I can hear myself, but I wonder if you can hear me... Yes. Vlad Oprea, the leader of PSD Titu, is upset by our presence at the meeting and tries to put things in order Come on, be kind and understand. We will speak with you outside, at the end of the information session. So we cannot stay? No, if you are kind... But, why? What's to hide? We have nothing to hide, but... In this case, let us in... Our colleagues are intimidated by your presence... We manage to convince them that there's no reason to feel intimidated. I am gonna give the floor to my colleagues, including the priests from our village, priests who have initiated                                                           this operation at a national level, by gathering the 3 million signatures. The moral health of our nation is not measured by some millions of euros - the cost of this referendum The money could have been spent on \n     some wonderful things, that's for sure, but it's more wonderful to keep our heads up when, in some years, our children will be grown up. So, I think that you all know what to do... As for myself, I say it very clear,               \n         as I said it before in the Parliament I am against any form of violence, verbal or physical abuse pointed   \n       towards those who have different preferences. Well, I, as a Christian, consider that this is a sin! Some said that there's no point in spending a couple of              tens of millions of euros for this referendum. The priest said it very well: We, a large group of people, consider that it                      is the best investment in the future of this country. Because, frankly , the kids show up from a relationship between a man and a woman. If this referendum won't pass, the consequences will be of a certain nature... We need to have about 6 million                         Romanians at the polls to make the referendum valid. And I, as a senator of Romania, I encourage you, as a romanian and as a Christian, to do your civic duty. No one is forcing you, but I think           \n            that you should express your thoughts by voting, whether it's on the 6th,                               \n           on Saturday, or on the 7th, on Sunday. So, there are no questions? Thank you very much! Good luck and let's hope for a wealthy harvest! The day before, Viorica Dăncilă, the Prime Minister of Romania, had assured the  MEP's that Romanian social democrats will not campaign for the referendum. We will see what will happen,                     \n                if the people will go to vote or not. The Social Democratic Party of    \n            Romania will not get involved in a campaign. Will not be campaigning! It's everyone's duty to take action so that all the          people understand what this referendum is about. But we will not be campaigning                \n     to influence in one direction or another. Prime Minister Dăncilă clarified at Bruxelles that there will be no campaign... Well, this is no campaign, it's some information session... You've been inside... You said: „I advice you to go and vote!“ No, any person, any person That's what you said! I encourage anyone to vote as they wish. It's a citizen's duty to express their opinion. But I didn't tell them how to vote. It's a big difference. 10 minutes before As for myself, it's a well known fact even those who are present here and are representing the \"Resist group\" - that's what I know about that website, so, those who are opposing this referendum, they know very well that I will vote „Yes“. It's my choice as a citizen, I am Christian,                                     I am glad that I live in a Christian country. The \"information sessions\" held by Social Democratic Party continued the same day in other villages. They are using the ignorance. What you saw there are                            \n                the workers from the city hall, from the school. The mayor's relatives are working at the school. Before every election day,                    \n          these folks are going through the village and say: „Grandma, do you see these roses?“ (roses are the the electoral sign of PSD ) „Yes, love, I can see them“ „Well, these are the ones you will mark at the polls, understand?“ I understand, yes.“ They didn't even have to tell us what to vote for                                   because we know, it's rational...? It's normal. That's the campaign. So, for who will we vote for? What for? Well... To be man with woman... Well, that's not ok, that's not right. We heard, we saw on television and it's not pleasant to do something like this. Those who want to do things like this can move to the Netherlands, can go anywhere else, can change his citizenship... We are a stable nation,                              \n            we were born here, we are not just a gathering. If two men get married, they cannot have kids Two woman can't have children, That means that some years from now The Earth will be... empty, right? In other countries that's                          \n            how they do it? Woman with woman? Yes. And man with man. Holy shit! It's a mad world! The end of the world is coming!"}

A teacher that taught at three of the best high schools in Bucharest: Sfantul Sava, Mihai Viteazul and Tudor Vianu speaks of the ignored cancer in the Romanian school system. In the first year they tried, in a box of \"Merci\" around Christmas... A voucher Parents test you They come once, twice. They test you with a bottle of something... If... If it works, they do it again, if you get revolted... George Trifan is a teacher associated with the National College of Computer Science \"Tudor Vianu\" from Bucharest The school inspector is named politically, the principals are named politically... And the kids can tell at one point that there is something wrong, some even rebel... They all want to leave I sometimes argue with them on Facebook If you all leave, who's left behind? Who will pay for my pension? The disease of the education system In my opinion the biggest plague of the education system is tenure If you have tenure, time goes on, you get paid, basically that's it It's as if your workplace gave you a contract for life If you have yields or not, regardless of whether you go to work... It's as if you go to work and waste your time on Facebook And nobody can fire you because you have tenure That's the situation as far as the state system is concerned Practically, if you don't rape or murder a child with witnesses, because the syndicate will come in And they will try to lessen it. They will say that they enjoyed being raped or ... They will adjust the circumstances. Nothing will happen to you. It's one of the reasons I don't want tenure. I am also comfortable. I'd get lazy if knew that whatever... Whatever I do or don't do... Nothing happens to me, where's my motivation? Parents and end of year gifts What's the deal with these gifts? They test me as well. They come once, twice. They test you with a bottle of something... If... If it works, they do it again, if you get revolted... In the first year they tried, in a box of \"Merci\" around Christmas... A voucher I saw the voucher, I made a scene and... Now I don't know how many of my colleagues refused the voucher What I did and shamed them I told the children: \"Look at what your parents did!\" Look, they made a pool and bought a voucher What do you think about that? Especially because I told them during the first class that of Computer Science that we are friends. And that we can talk about anything. I ask them: \"What do you feel about giving money among friends?\" And I explained to them that I get paid Poorly, as you well know Nobody forces me, I do this by choice You don't have to make up for the fact that the state pays me poorly. And it never happened again. What did the children say? The children went home and chastised their parents because \"look George was upset because of what you did!\" And it never happened again. Next year They made a Christmas tree adorned with key-caps from old computers. And I felt it was an appropriate gift, a gift... What can I say? It was a way to appreciate my effort... not a form of bribe I consider that, as a teacher, I had a normal attitude and I educated them, in a way, not to do that And I think they understood I'm certain they understood Children need to learn it's not normal to bribe. If we teach them from school to bribe Then we wonder that they, as adults, take bribes. What is in the mind of a high school teacher? A lot of my colleagues forget why they come to school They forget that we come for the kids. And they behave as if they come to school for themselves, For the principal, for the boss, for... We forget... Teaching ends up last, a subsidiary. It's the thing we care about the least. It's something most of them do, when the bell is rung they go to class They can't wait for class to end so they can busy themselves with other things in school. Some of us actually try to be good teachers. I, at least, try... In my way and at my level, to change something That is why I became a teacher, to make a change What do you need to know when you are a teacher? Essentially you need to know how to sell your \"wares\". The child has 10, 12, 15 courses, And they can't study everything properly And so a sort of competition appears You need to defeat Facebook, Instagram The girlfriend, boyfriend, soaps and so on... and grab their attention at least for half an hour, forty minutes, to share something Children are the best yardstick They evaluate you at once. You don't get the chance to open your mouth, say something about... Your specialty, children can read you as a person If they perceive you as weak, they will run you out of your classroom. Our role as teacher is not what it once was In the countryside, the teacher, the priest are still respected In that way of thinking But in Bucharest, the bigger cities The teacher is just another member of society, less so even with a lower wage. For example a local policeman earns double. George Trifan teaches at a private school in Bucharest as well The differences between state and private school: Here, at the Metropolitan school there are classes with five, six pupils It's like tutoring, and you work much better It's far easier to take care of the needs of each pupil. When you have five or ten pupils in a class. It's another thing as at Vianu where, paradoxically, sometimes there's even 37 pupils in a classroom. Which is over the legal number allowed And all sorts of people with approvals from the ministry, the inspectorate... And you overfill a classroom where 37 people will not fit. We don't have 37 computers in the Computer Science lab... There is a limit but that limit can be ignored if need be Education as a political instrument The school inspector is named politically, the principals are named politically... And the kids can tell at one point that there is something wrong, some even rebel, they get outraged... Often they are silenced Their behavior grade gets lowered for exotic reasons. They all want to leave... I sometimes argue with them on Facebook If you all leave, then who's left? Who will pay for my pension? Most of them want o leave so they won't meet people Like a lot of their teachers So they won't see an unstable political environment as in our country, So they won't see an literate prime-minister These are the reasons why these kids want to leave. Even some of my colleagues feel like there's nothing left here Why do you get outraged because they want to leave? I was arguing last week with a colleague, Romanian language teacher, on Facebook \"If you as a teacher think there's nothing left here and you should leave, then resign\", I told her. What are you doing, what is the end result of your work if you lost hope? What is left to do in the Romanian school system? What to do? Oh dear! There's potential, talented kids... There's plenty to do I honestly believe that I was born with a purpose here I was abroad I came back, I'm not leaving again And I will do my best to do some good here."}

He was swearing at me all day long because I couldn't understand the language. I have been living in Italy for 17 years, I have my activities, my vans, my car, my house, I've got everything I need! My children... One graduating high school now, the other one graduating University; the difference is very big. They don't even want to hear about Romania. I tell them that we are going to go on holiday in Romania, they tell me \"No, you are going to Romania, we are going to France, Corsica...\" We arrive in Bucharest Do you know where to go? We go directly to The Victory Square, right? In 350 meters, go ahead to remain on  Basarab's Passage Turn left to remain in The Victory Square #DIASPORA IS COMING #HOME \"Italy!\" \"Spain!\"\" LIKE THE TWO PREVIOUS MEN, IN THE VICTORY SQUARE HAVE GATHERED OTHER THOUSANDS OF ROMANIANS WHO WORK ABROAD MADRID\nROMANIA WE LOVE YOU!

You can't! COME HOME I have a life there too. But I want to live my life at home with my friends, with my family, not... I mean... When I'm here I miss that place, because I have been there for a lot of years. When I'm there, I miss this place, and, in the end, I wish i was here. I have been living in Italy for 47 years What did you miss the most while you were living there? Bucharest... and the friendly atmosphere 28 years ago, exactly during The Revolution, I had the chance to leave, to settle down there (Netherlands) You realize that, every year, I come home 2-3 times to visit my parents. And now, finally, we are at the end of our rope, as they say... IGNORED BY POLITICIANS, THE ROMANIANS FROM DIASPORA COMPLAINED TO THE GENDARMES Tomorrow, my children and yours, maybe not yours but mine will work on Dragnea's cotton plantations! Tomorrow, my children, and maybe yours, will work on Dragnea's cotton plantations! Trust me! ...if it's all going like this! There are those scoundrels that have a higher status than you do But you can unite, you can write, you can do! Not necessarily with the batons, it can be written down! Yes, we unite and then they fire us. And what do we do then? No! He's young, he's 20 years old, but I'm 41. If they fire all of you, the would have no one else. That's what people don't understand! My military ID says \"Sergeant Major\"... and with high pride... I left the country! It's been 20 years since then! Nobody dies of hunger! Do you feel good when you turn on the TV with your child and she (the PM) says: \"I'm happy I've come to Pristina\" And your child says \"Dad, but I learned at geography that she went in Montenegro, not Pristina.\" What do you tell them? When a stupid person represents you, you cannot evolve! You can't! You can't! They destroyed our educational system They said \"Take their educational system, keep their heads down\" They've done it being aware that people will leave the country because they have to earn their bread So, not even in my most horrible nightmares have I imagined that I will live to see something like that again in Romania I've lived here during the The Revolution and I cannot believe what is happening here right now I work in England, I came here especially for this day. I am devastated, I am devastated! They have used, I don't know what sort of spray... My eyes, neck and face are burning, itching, But what hurts the most is my soul because I'm experiencing this situation now in Romania I left after 35 years of work in Romania I went to Germany, six weeks I have scrubbed kitchens and hotels. I don't know German, and because I know English I applied in England In the meantime I qualified as a \"care assistant\", so I take care of the elders. That's what I do... This is the story, but my heart is broken because of what is happening here Have a good night! See you tomorrow! ♫ In the country where I was born / Today everything is sad and silent, ♫ You can't hear any nightingales/ There's no more choirs nor violins. ♫ In the country where I was born/\nIn the country where I was born...

These are the kind of people we will assist! Yeah, it won't be easy. So, I go to the information desk and I fill in the form... Yes, baby, upstairs, you tell them you want a free pass \nfor the border and they will give it to you. And in three days you can pick it up. It won't be long till then... Nobody Home A documentary by \nRecorder So, it's this. Yes. I think they are the same. \nWait, no! This one is heavier. Oh, something fell in my eye. Let's see! My right arm is stronger. No, this one. This is heavier? This one. OK, so we leave this one at check in... … The 20 kilos one. Yes. The one you were talking about. And in this one you put only what you take with you. In this one? And we are now taking the things\n we don't need any more to Lupeni. No, we need to take everything to Lupeni. The point is to keep what you take with you and everything else needs to go anywhere else but here. Good! We throw away this one, when she's not looking. No, honey, pack it, we can take it to Lupeni. And what will we do with it? We can give it away to some girl over there. Bucharest\n29 days until departure I feel like I'm doing something crazy. \nBut I am doing it for the kids. And, yes, I do it for us too. Because we can't live here anymore. All my friends encouraged me to “Leave!”,\nnobody said “It's a mistake!”. And why stay here, since I can see with my own eyes that it is not good for me. One thing on top of the other, when I draw the line every month I see that the money isn't enough. Why stay here and suffer some more? It sounds crazy, all of this. And I think it might be crazy. \nBut it is crazy in a good way. England, here we come! We signed a contract, at a home for the elderly who need care assistants. Should I take this one? Yes, take it. Some of the residents there have dementia. \nAnd some are really old. They are people too. I didn't do this kind of job before, but I need to start somehow, right? I am moving there with two children,\n I need to start somewhere. And yes, maybe it will be Ok and they will \nappreciate me more over there, right? There are more opportunities there to advance. You don't need anyone to \nprop you to get ahead. I mean, if you are good at your job \nand you're honest, you can grow. We throw these away. No, love, take them, they can \nmake rags out of them in Lupeni. I can't say I’ve had enough... Well, I had enough. I didn’t. I like it! I had enough. Starting with the traffic jams, with the fact that a trip nearby to Brasov takes about five to six hours because we have no highways and if we did, probably it’ll work for two or three years, and they’ll need to repair them so I feel like getting the Hell out of here. And I swear to you, I won't even look \ndown at the country from the airplane. And I want to stay there for as long as possible, \nto see my children settled down and maybe, only maybe, when \nI am old and retired, I will come back to Romania. It sucks that in our country, the people who are in charge, the politicians, somehow force us to leave. It's like they say: “Go! So we can stay behind”. And people give up because you feel\n too small to do anything, to fight back. They don't even obey the laws. They only pass laws to protect themselves. I mean, we froze while protesting\n in Victoriei Square. And what for? So, you can only take what you need, because\n there is no room on the airplane, OK? And this gun? Yes, you can take the gun. I want to take all the toys! A gun in an airplane? \nYou think they will allow you to go with it? No, the police will stop you. I will die in that airplane. Why?! Because I think it's very hot inside and I will sweat and... Hot, where? Inside the airplane. No, sweetie, it is not. In my heart, I am a patriot. I strongly \nbelieve that one day, Romania will rise. 20 days until departure Oh, what a mouthful! Boy, oh, boy, what have you done! Boy, oh, boy! Boy, oh, boy! 19 days until departure I told you to bring the big polenta plate. Bigger? There isn't a bigger one. It's big enough, Dani. Need more polenta? No, we have pasta as well. No more, mom, we're good.\n  Listen to her: “more mămăliga”. Then I won't make any more.\nSit down for a minute, No… don't run away! I used to work in the UK, and we had a fixed schedule. We weren't allowed to work more than 8 hours a day. When the alarm went on, you had to put down the pot with the plants you were working on. Where was that? In the UK. The UK?\nYes. It's great, I am very happy they took this decision. Surely their lives will completely change. Romanians are welcomed in the UK. Anywhere in this world, they show you respect,\n if you are an honest man. Danut, promise you will come home\n for the Holidays, next year, for Easter? Nope. Why? Maybe in two years. I need to settle down before, godmother. \n I am not going there as a tourist. And you need a whole year for that? More salt? They are very tasty. I want ciorba (Romanian soup ed.). For real? 15 days until departure Can we come in? Come in, come in. Are you\n all leaving, the young lady too? Yes, everybody. Oh, my! \nAnd who will visit me then? We can take you with us. The weather there... I know. … will be a big problem. I mean, I heard from people who used to live there, \nwho although they were – how can I put this? socially accepted and well paid, they had \nto return to Romania because of the weather. So, you don't need to come for any more vaccines. They need to be done at the age of five. There is the MMR (Measels. Mumps and Rubella) vaccine at the age of five, and at six, there's the Tetra... \nsinus... tetra-something vaccine. And the same rules apply abroad? I can't say. But they have a strict vaccination program, it's not like you can decide, like here “Oh, I don't want my kid to be vaccinated, \nfor I-don't-know-what reason”. You must do it; you are fined if you refuse. Will any of your grannies go with you? No. So, I will give you a prescription for\n some saline solution, you never know... and let's see what the doctor has to say. Yeah, the humidity there is a problem, \nmany people have asthma. 6 days until departure Good morning! The duckling is waking up... Isn't she? Look what I have for you. Good... morning! Are we getting out of the bed? Baby, where are we going today? Where to? I don't know... You don't? I don't know... Where are we going today? Where are we going today? Honey? Can I make the bed and take everything to my mom's? Yes, you need to take everything to your \nmom's, every single thing that’s on the bed. These past days were traumatising... Last night? You don't want to know. We were very nervous, from the stress, the exhaustion. We were this close to fighting. We packed so many things; I don't even\n know how we could have gathered so many. You can't imagine how many things... Take my advice: don't ever move! Yes, it's not... Don't ever move! I have holy water, want some holy water? This one... You’ll take that mask? Dida, we're not keeping these, right? There you go. I don't know why we buy so many things, really. We don't even use half of them. Can you please turn that down? Water... the trash is out...\nthe windows are closed... Well, I'm like so-so... I am a bit sad, but also \nglad that we are making a change. That's the reason we are leaving, after all. I mean... I feel like this... Stefan, Dida, are you too hot? Are you happy you are leaving, Dida? No. \nNo? No... You are supposed to carry the backpack on your back... Oh, you scared me! You scared me, boy! What? Are you upset? I'm sleepy. Are you sleepy? Where to? The Militari Bus Station. Hey, how are you? Fine, we are going to play footbal. Hi! Have a safe trip! Thank you!\n You are welcomed to visit us, OK? Be well. We will be. We have to be. Goodbye, little monkey! Feeling sleepy? Yo, where to so early in the morning? At the football match. Come on; the car is waiting. Bye! We will see each other when we call... Goodbye! See you. Oh, so you returned to Romania because of your family. Yes. My wife couldn't adapt over there. I see. And? Were things working out for you over there? No. No. As an Uber driver? And you used to live in London, downtown? We are going somewhere near London. Tetbury. The rent wasn't that expensive, because we were splitting the costs with other residents. I understand. I was paying about like 70 pounds a week. But, anyway, it was expensive. There were apartments to rent in the outskirts for 100 pounds a month. Interesting... Interesting... Is that our bus? Yes. Is this bus going to Petrosani? Stefi, hold this. Daddy! Yes, Stefan. My pillow stays in the trunk? No, sweetie, we take it inside the bus. Lupeni, Hunedoare county\n5 days until departure You know, in a way, it hurts to see them leave. But I am glad they are taking the chance. Later in life, they won't have this\n strength, to take the chance again. But you know what I don’t like? That \nRomanians abroad don't stand up for each other. Every nation, even the Albanians,\n who are mean people, help each other. Not the Romanians. They\ndrag each other down. Let me taste it. Here. Yeah, I love it at home, I like speaking Romanian, I like living here, but at some point, you’ll find that the people all around you won't leave you in peace, you know, the people who run the country. And, as I was saying, you can't change a thing. \nWe are too small to change something. Wait until your son will curse at you in English and \nyou will be like “What's that? What did he say?”. That's nothing! What if one of the elderly\n you'll assist will ask you to shave him and you'll think he wants\n you to take his slippers off his feet. Her TV is set on RTV and \nAntena 3 news stations, all day long! Lots of people were content to get\n a pair of shoes or wood for the fire as a campaign gift; things politicians give away once every \nfour years if they give you anything at all... Look at them now; they are very generous! … And after that your energy bill goes up,\n your gas bill goes up, everything goes up. But there were so many abusive \ndecisions in the justice system... My mom supports the PSD (the ruling party Social Democratic Party ed.)! Well, it's true! We, the elderly, can compare what's happening today with what was going on in the past. OK, but you are aware that the guy\n (Liviu Dragnea, PSD's leader ed.) is being prosecuted? Or you don't believe that? Yes, I know he is prosecuted. So we agree. Then why is he running the country? Those investigations... No, they sentenced him for manipulating the elections or whatever. That he bribed peasants. Right. And you think that is a good\n reason to sentence someone? No! They should have proved that his fortune is illegal! Do you want to choose a power for this game? Yeees! Stop shouting! Let's run. So we'll get there faster. 2 days until departure Now I have to be beautiful before I leave! Yes, of course, I'll give it a bob cut. In the first place, we are leaving for our children. And I look forward to the age of 60 to \nreturn here and live as a Romanian citizen. I don't know why, but we, \nas Romanians, are such vile people! Simply vile! When you see what's happening in the \ncountry when you look at what's going on at the top. They just keep stealing more, and more, and more! They do not stop, they have no limits. I can't understand... Are we all the same or... You, the younger generation, \nhave different standards, you have children, you have… You keep thinking about the future, \nand that scares you, I feel. You don't have any hope, because you think:\n what will happen to my children if these politicians keep stealing our country's resources, where are we headed as a nation? Oh my, I really like my home a lot. I think in another life I was a walnut. Because my roots are deeply rooted into the ground. Here your hair is very dense. Dyeing your hair makes it denser. Mommy! Take off your hat. No.\nCome on baby. Come on, love, just take... I just want to see it! Come on, love, I just want to see how it looks. I like it; I really like how it turned out. I don't like it at all. Just look at this part! That's how it's supposed to look, it looks good. Just look at this part.\nThis is exactly what I didn't want. You showed her a picture of how you wanted it to be.Well, it looks just like in the picture. Just look at this bang though! But I like it how it is. Don't you remember I told her \nto not leave this bang here? Look, it's still here! Well, otherwise you won’t have the right \nshap. But I like how she cut it. Who's there? Happy birthday, Happy birthday to you! It really came out nice. Make sure you don't trip, love. Look how nice it is! I want this piece! Hey, be nice! Mommy, I want this piece! Yes, I hear you. I'm stressed out! They're stressing me out, my mother, Dani,\n and I'm stressing myself out. Enough, son, if you pull too hard, it will break... Let me kiss you for your birthday. I brought you something to play with. I don't know \nif you like toy cars. Do you like toy cars? Yes. Do you know which kind these are?\n These are the ones you pull and after they go. Clau is that type of friend, that when you're upset she doesn't say\"God, what have you done wrong?\", but \"OK, who do we need to beat up?\". And Dana's the same for me. Everything's going to be fine... I don't have any doubts. Dana is Dana. Airplanes tickets will always be there... Girl, I have an empty room, just so you know. You know why it's easier now?\n Because we're leaving together. Not just one of us, like before, but all of us. And your children won't call you\n “Auntie” when you get back. I know, I'm never going to forget when \nAndreea (Dida) called her “auntie” when Dana came back for the first time home. Because she left her when \nshe was younger than a year old. 11 months. Yeah, that's what I remember,\n she was younger than a year old. Yeah... Do you remember when we left\n at night to go eat shawarma in the city? Yeah, Dana was pregnant with Andreea. I said... “It's closed!” No it's not. We went with a van. We bought what we needed, and we came back on foot, from Barbateni. We had too. How many kilometres are there till England? How many? 2,000 approximate. See. Yeah. At least in thought. I'll be 45 minutes from... Bucharest! Three and a half hours from Bucharest. And 2 miles from Prince Charles. 2 miles?... About 4 kilometres, 3 kilometres and a bit. Make sure to drink your five o'clock tea. The last barbeque in Romania! For the fire something nice! (“With all my heart for Romania”)   But you see, people just got used to the \nidea: “I don't need school”. I would let my students know in the past years, that “You can do it, with school \nand knowledge you can be somebody”. They would always respond, “but miss why should we? Becali (a Romanian business man Ed) \ndidn't go to school. I'll finish school if I finish, and I'll just leave the country. You can find lots of jobs”. Find what? To be somebody's slave. “So what? I can earn money”. OK then, go ahead, I tell them.\nGo experience the world then we'll talk later. And everybody ends up leaving \nbecause they don't have a better option. I know. I went into town, and I couldn't recognize a single face. Same, and I live here! All done, Cârlig? Yup yup! Don't worry, everything's going to be OK. It's going to be better! No! No? NO! Yes, it will, Dani thinks so. What does Dani say? That it's going to be better. And that Oli should retire so we can come as well. So you made a plan. Don't worry... Do you miss her? No, it's just weird because we have\n to say goodbye to our friends. That's how I felt with my classmates,\n I just wanted to cry. When you grow older you learn to control those feelings. Come on Stefan! Stefan! Bye, say “bye”! I regret the fact that I'm leaving, basically. I don't regret anything, man. I really can't say I have any regrets. Nothing is holding me back. Absolutely nothing. I don't know, I feel powerless, and disappointed that we have to leave. I sit alone sometimes and say to myself, “Jesus what more do I need”? But after that... OK, my child needs\n a better future, better options. I don't want my child to carry\n that extra weight, that I had to. My generation is and continues to be;\n a generation that must sacrifice. I participated in the protests, in the cold rain, \nand the politicians didn't even care about us. Maybe they pull the curtains from the Government building, where we protest, to check, but for nothing. Lupeni, Hunedoara county, \n24 hours until departure Check it out, guys. I think I found the spot. How do you expect me to see? Well, I saw. You just have to... wait. I weighed it already. Ohooo, you can put more inside, love! Yeah, but none of them have 10 kilograms. Wow, that's awesome! These are only 5 kilograms. Oh my, oh my! If I knew this was coming I would\n have had five children. Even seven! At least one of them would have stayed home with me. What does “thank you” mean? “Thank you” means\n “Multumesc” (Romanian for “Thank you” Ed.). I woke up at 5.23. When I saw 23 I said, “Ahh, I have to wake up, I put my alarm at 6.30”. And then I saw it was only five o’clock. Everything's so quite. Just wait to see when you all leave. Not even a fly will be heard. F...k this, I can't wait to leave. To integrate there already. I'm just a little bit stressed. And tired.\nI told you, last night I didn't really sleep. Please leave me a shirt of yours so I can wear it from\ntime to time, so they remind me of you... Or shorts! My darling! On your hands! Rub it in faster, faster! This is an ugly moment... a tough situation, Only time can tell what will happen... It's ripped here. Is it ripped? Yeah, here under its eye. He's injured, he fought a dog. He's a dog. And half Hippopotamus. Oh really?\nHe fought another hippo-dog. Hippo... Hippo-dog! My darling! My dearest! What's up, man? You guys are leaving already without saying goodbye? Coming on the bike, I see? Of course! I thought you would walk. Well when you will have a beer, how will you ride it then? Walk next to it? Here’s the beer! Aaa.. You keep the bottle close, I get it. Of course. All ready? Yup. We're going to England! In England, good job! Well... Well, let me kiss you goodbye. Safe journey. Thanks! Be safe, and good here, and hopefully \nyou invite us to the wedding. Of course, I'll make sure to look after\n Mrs. Mariana until she leaves. You have his number right? Of course, she does! Here comes the bus! It might be the “local bus”. No its the one for Uricani (a city nearby Ed.) Safe travels, bye bye. Hopefully, we have room inside... Everybody in, before me, so I can pay. Be safe, everybody! You as well! Come on children! Route Lupeni – Petroșani Wow, how cute, you already put on the shirt? Mommy?\nWhere's your other shirt? Here, in the bag. I'm moving to England! Bus station.\nPetroșani - Hunedoara county Safe trip back home, call us when you arrive. Of course. God bless you two and be happy. And you two should never fight. Never! Who, us? Never! You should never fall asleep while mad at each other! Which one’s your seat? 29-34. I can't wait to get on the airplane. Route Petroșani – Cluj-Napoca Look, the plane is going to do this... 4 hours until departure\nCluj-Napoca What have I learned? I don't know exactly... I regret that I didn't appreciate \nthe time spent in Romania more. I regret that I'm leaving, that's the basic idea. We need to leave only our bags,\n we don't have to go through check in anymore. Gates 13-14, yup. Unfortunately, I leave with a bitter taste. That's also “thanks” to those who\n insist on running this country. I leave everything Romanian behind. I love it when I wake up in\n the morning and hear the birds singing, I love the smell of home. I love it when I walk down the street and somebody asks me randomly, “hello, how are you? Are you OK”. Everything that is Romanian,\nI leave behind, and I’m leaving. And I'm trying to be strong and not look back... Stefan are you OK? Are you sleepy? My munchkin! Wait, but if we leave at six, there's\n no way we can get there by seven. Of course, we can, because in England the\n time zone is two hours behind Romania. Well, what time will we arrive local time Romania? 8 o'clock. What? 9 o'clock. You don't know your maths... Neither do you. Me neither... A Film by Andrei Udișteanu Camera and Sound \nDavid Muntean Post Production\nCristian Delcea Tetbury, England\n24 hours later. Hello. This is a park next to us. Who wants to say hello to Andrei and David? Hey! Hooray, good job! This is basically how the park that’s next to us looks. Only green as far as we can see. Let's see Daniel one more time. Wow, bravo! Say “Bye”! Goodbye! Goodbye guys! Thanks to... Music... This film would not have been possible without the countless donations towards Recorder.ro. Thank you!"}

Because in Romania there is always a problem, there is always a messy situation, there is always... This kind of lazyness and everyone cares only about the things that directly affect them. WHAT WERE THEY HOPING TO FIND IN THE ROMANIAN SCHOOLS? What was I hoping for? This will sound a bit mean, but… civilisation. At first, I tried to go to university here, and it wasn’t as nice as I was hoping it to be, so I decided to go abroad in the end. WHOSE FAULT IS IT? There are a lot of political problems, like corruption and so on.. A lot of problems, but I think that we should all look at ourselves first. I believe that the problem starts when kids are still in high school I think we should work on the mentality that is instilled amongst students You have to go with chocolates and perfume (i.e as bribe) HOW DID THE WESTERN WORLD CAPTIVATE THEM? I got used to everything working extremely well in Vienna. The tube comes exactly when it’s supposed to come, there’s no surprise. I’ve never met a brit that is late. People are fair, people respect the rules, people are polite. WE TALKED TO 7 ROMANIANS WHO ARE STUDENTS AT DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES AROUND EUROPE TO FIND OUT HOW THEY SEE ROMANIA I remember when I first went to school for my interview and we had to fly from Romania and I think my dad was trying to find out the exact time for the interview with the principal of the boarding school and the principal of the school. The secretary there didn’t really understand why it was so important for us to find out an exact time, and eventually told us that once we’ll get there, because it was us travelling from another country, the principal will be there and we'll be able to have the interview. And my dad was really shocked because he had previously tried for two weeks to get my grades, which had to be translated and sent to Austria, from the principal of my school in Romania. Here you had to go with chocolates and perfume (i.e. as bribe to get anything done) and in Austria the principal was planning his schedule around mine. I first tried to go to university here and it wasn’t as nice as I was hoping it to be so I decided to move abroad. THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM It’s very different. First, they make you work without necessarily stressing you out, but you really have to put in the effort. The fact that you’re learning so much without even realising the effort you are making is, in my opinion, essential. This is something that they have achieved there, and I hope they will manage to achieve the same thing here. It suited my field of study really well. I feel I grew more as an artist because I went abroad. It's based a lot more on your skills, so... you can really apply the things that you learn, in comparison to Romania where you simply learn everything by heart but without understanding anything… you learn it by heart. I believe that the problem with the Romanian educational system lies somewhere deeper, we’re talking about lower salaries, the level of training teachers get, and therefore their involvement in the lessons. The relationship between students and their tutors was a big shock for me. I thought it was very open, the students could talk to their tutors about anything, and the relationship was much more personal then it is here where the tutor is somewhere up here, and the students are way down here. I think it is easier (i.e as a tutor) to be motivated when you are paid the way you are paid abroad. I think you are more motivated to do your work. I believe this is an important factor as well. I see many students, in our universities, who aren’t necessarily motivated and I’m assuming that as a tutor, after a couple of years, you might lose your enthusiasm as well. THE HOMEWORK What can Romanians learn from the Brits? They trust each other more. And I think this comes from a greater self-confidence. People are fair, they respect the rules, people are polite. Austrians don’t really start things without at least believing that they will finish them. I’ve never met someone there that does something just for the sake of it. I mean, if they start doing something they already know what will happen once they're done. They have a really good plan for everything. The majority of young people in Romania are unaware of the world we are living in and that is also because our parents don’t  fully comprehend that we live in a capitalist world. WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT ROMANIA? The politicians... ...for sure. We should have someone with a different mentality come into power and impose certain things, because if you don’t show people a different perspective you can't just expect everyone to change all of a sudden. Political strategies, in other coutries, are not made for only four years, for as long as a politician is in office, they’re made for 20, 30 years. There shouldn’t be a new plan every time we chose a new government, someone that comes with another „amazing” idea, so that some can get out of jail, or something. There should be a long-term plan. Maybe they should get some inspiration from the Nordics because they’re the ones that do it best apparently. To follow the law. I mean, if it says that there is a certain speed limit and you don’t respect it, you should be punished just like in any other country. You shouldn’t have the option to give bribes... On the one side, they talk about the parallel state, and it’s the only topic of the political discourse and on the other side they’re talking about corruption, which of course, it’s a huge problem, but it’s also almost the only topic of their political discourse. It seems that they are focusing on a populist speech, maybe on both sides of the political spectrum, that doesn’t lead to anything good for us, and especially for the young generation who need a political education that’s missing entirely from Romania. I do believe that things will change in the next elections. I mean, people have become much more politically active, much more aware of everything that’s going on, not only of the bigger issues. THE HARDEST QUESTION.... Do you plan to move back to Romania? I don’t think so. Why? Because I got used to everything working extremely well in Vienna. Are you going to move back to Romania after...? I don’t think so. I don’t want to say no, I can’t say yes either. I'm not that patriotic to say that I will come back home and I will change the country, because I won't. It's not necessarily that I don’t want to return to Romania but I don’t know exactly where I want to live in the future. I do believe that things can change, and yes, I believe I can change something the same way every person my age or from my generation can change something. The main reason I moved back is because I believe I can bring here what I’ve learnt abroad and develop the field of contemporary dance and contemporary art in Romania. Would you like to move back to Romania? Yes, yes. Why? Because I like it here a lot and for now there is no other place where I can express myself more freely than in Romania. I personally see Romania as a place where there is a lot of room for development. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have returned if I didn’t think that I could develop something here. But what about those that have left and decide to remain there...? I understand them perfectly. I hope that they will vote, as I heard it usually happens with those living abroad. I understand that they can often make a difference. I understand if they are not coming back. I would really like them to see Romania as a place where they could return, even if they choose not to. I would like us to get to that point where they would say: „look, I could come back, it’s ok but I’m used to living here, so I’ll stay here” But I’m not staying just because it sucks to live in Romania, that’s the point. I’m only staying because I’m used to being here."}

Am văzut, în schimb, o sală plină cu liberali aduși din toată țara să asiste la startul campaniei electorale a lui Klaus Iohannis. L-am văzut pe Klaus Iohannis, care, la șase luni după ce a numit-o pe Viorica Dăncilă în funcția de premier, pare să-și dea seama că n-a fost tocmai inspirat. Am văzut niște lideri PNL, care în ciuda multor moțiuni eșuate încă mai speră să le pună cineva guvernarea pe tavă. Am văzut un lider al opoziției, Ludovic Orban, amuzat, voios, dar inconsistent și incapabil să lupte cu omologul său de pe stânga. Am văzut o opoziție blocată în glume despre Viorica Dăncilă și _ _ _ _ PSD. Așa a fost Consiliul Național al PNL: scurt și vesel ca o serbare de sfârșit de an.\n\nRecorder este o publicație online construită de o echipă de jurnaliști în jurul acestor principii: jurnalism onest, făcut cu pasiune și pus în serviciul public.

How are you, Your Excellency? I came to you to support what we have started... Ludovic Orban, the president of the main oposition party is doing his number Tormented by internal conflicts, the liberals looked for salvation in the person of Klaus Iohannis (President of Romania) Allow me to invite the guaranter of democracy in Romania, the guaranter of Romania's euro-atlantic fate, the guaranter of normality, the President of Romania, Klaus Werner Iohannis! 6 months after he named Viorica Dancila as Primer Minister, the President notes that he wasn't very inspired. I am only telling you the latest thing, because there's many, it is an endless list! So Ms. Prime Minister published in the Official Journal a decision through which she established an interimary Prime Minister Suprise! I thought that is my attribute! Ms. Prime Minister called me to tell me that she is going on holiday and that everything is well. I, however, drew her attention upon what she did and said that it's not okay and that her decision is a base for a constitutional conflict. And do you know what she said to me? That she didn't know that it was published! What followed was the \"Do you still want me as your president?\" moment. There's only one thing left to clarify. I get involved, I fight for a strong Romania, for a flourishing Romania, and I am asking you: Are you with me in this fight? Are you with me in this fight? Yeeees! The delegates from the country were deeply impressed by the President's speech. Very Interesting... What did you like the most? The accuracy of the arguments, but we'll see... what we are going to do in the country! We are very delighted by the presence of mister President! So, the presence of mister President was to unify us, so there's no more disjoints within the party, so there's no more debates, because if we are not a united party like this... if we are not like this as a party, the PSD (Social Democrat Party) will dominate us! The National Liberal party is ready to govern! This team can be activated in any moment, it can be created, and the portfolios than need to be managed are ready to be taken over by the National Liberal Party. The National Liberal Party?\nI think it has ten people on each position, I am being honest. \nBut competent people, we don't gather \"yes-men\"! At PSD (Social Democrat Party) there's only yes-men who do not even know well the Romanian language!"}

Down with the… Thousands protest in front of the parliament on the day                               of the censure motion against Dăncilă’s government Did you take a day off work to come here? We all took a day off from work to come here. Yes! We asked our director to give us two free hours and \n      we’ll make up tonight. We’ll rehearse more tonight. I’m a pensioner and I have time. I have no reason to \n      stay at home, even if it pours outside. We are waiting for the honorary resignation today,\nwe’re hoping that some lepers from PSD will cure themselves and \n       vote against. Don’t think that anyone will put you in jail for no reason! They’ll put you, because you did something! \nYou won’t do it anymore, you escape! The number of protestors rose due to the \n                     PNL members brought form the countryside PNL Ialomița... And who helped you, who organized for you to get here? Uhh... we did. The counselor of the deputy Gheorghe Tinel. We are one hundred people for Argeș county… What are you hoping for? For a change! Did you come here organized? Where form? Prahova. Well, they should leave us alone. PNL \nand Iohannis should leave the country because they didn’t do anything for anyone,\nhe didn’t employ the younger generation.He did nothing. In the area groups\nof PSD sympathizers also appeared As if we’re I don’t know what   \n  delinquents… You’re filming us like… Look, the instigators form PSD! \nThey come to the coalition rally! They have a list and check the ones that come, \nand they get 50 lei (n.r. 11 Euro) per day! Why are you lying? I saw it, I saw what she wrote there! They’re coming home from America to protest! Well, yes! They’re coming from Soros! Can’t you see ma’am that you ruin your children’s future? You’re ruining they’re future! Boo! Hello, hello… Let’s go more to that way… Don't you feel ashamed, you cow? After 40 years, for the hashtaggers to \n     come and lead our country!? That’s not normal! Ok? They are on drugs\nand drunk and everything! Meanwhile, in the parliament Resign! Resign! The illiterate! The illiterate! The illiterate! If this… motion would pass,           \nwhat would happen to this country? What will… How will the citizens live? Will it be better for them or worse? But the motion has no chances of passing since the opposition has more important things to do than to gather votes You refuse to admit even the \n     most obvious good things that happened during this governance… The USR and PNL leaders tried to at least win                   \nsome image points, by quickly crowd-surfing Good job guys! Good job, we love you! Good job! Good job, wish you good luck! We thank you for everything! Good job! Good job! Wish you good luck! Thank you very much! Two words, if you can say… Two, two… Mister Orban, wait! Please… Yes! Yes! Yes! We have mister Orban with us! Let’s \nlisten to him for a second while he delivers a message! About the lustration law... Thank you for being here! I appreciate you being     \n            involved in this battle! And, even if the result won’t be the one we    \nhope for, the battle continues and, ultimately, we will succeed in ending this vile regime, that mocks   \n     Romania and every single honest citizen from here! Thank you! Mister Ludovic Orban, \n               why are you here with the protesters?   You are a political figure! Gathera majority, \nto bring down the government, mister Orban! One second, just one, so we can take a picture… We don’t want Romanians to be influenced! I'm a citizen, just like you. You are a citizen but, firstly, you are a political figure! We don’t want our rally to be \ninfluenced by a political figure! But it isn’t fair to manipulate    \nthe rally, mister Orban! We want him to be here! He is a political figure! And so are you! \nWe don’t want him here! It’s not fair… Go away! … for a group of parliamentarians \nto come and destroy our rally! What do you mean by “our”? Who do you \nrepresent when you say “we don’t want”? Just like Barna and the others came… But you are not allowed to come\n here between us! He’s not allowed ma’am! Where does it say he’s not allowed? Who are you representing? \nWho are you representing? Why are you saying “we”? Go away from here! It isn’t fair for us to be manipulated by mister Orban! Politicians shouldn’t be here with us! Don’t push me! What are you doing?\nYou’re pushing me? No, you’re not right. Do you want me to call the police? What’s the problem? We don’t want to be influenced! Politicians    \n   aren’t allowed here with us at the rally! Taking into account all these things, there    \n                is only one voting possibility: to vote clearly against the motion! The vote lacked suspense The motion failed Viorica Dăncilă stays as Prime Minister In front of the parliament, people stayed                             \nand thought about they’re future I have children, grandchildren that left the country \nbecause of this. I see my grandchildren once a year. Two weeks ago, my granddaughter also left, she \nwas the only granddaughter that I still had in Romania. Young people are leaving, running away\nfrom this country. What can I say? A message for grandparents and parents: To call they’re children that are working           \n       abroad and to ask them why they left. That’s all. And I’m afraid that if we don’t all realize, we’ll end up in maximum one year and a half\nin the same situation like before ’89. It is painful, it is sad, but it is true. I don’t work for the state, I have a company. I’m struggling, fighting to earn some money to pay the \nRomanian state, Romanian state which screws me! That’s the way they screw me over! \nWhat more can I say? It hurts. It’s painful to watch my country   \n       going 30 years backwards. Our parents were wrong when they told   \nus to be compliant, because it is dangerous! I don’t want to do this with my children! \nMy children are here, with me, and I told them to come! This is what democracy means: to have a say, to  disagree and, if you disagree, to come out and protest! 6:30PM, Cotroceni neighborhood Clerks from the city hall were brought unwillingly\nto protest president Iohannis The protest ends up being a failure People are ashamed that they have to do this Would you want to tell me why you \n       are here or what… Do you want to tell us what you are here for today? Do you want to tell us what you are out today? Would you want to tell us what\n    you are walking here for? Do you want to tell us the reason \nfor this or…? No? However you wish. Hello! Do you want to tell me why you are here? Would you want to tell us why you are here today? Down with Iohannis! Down with Iohannis! Well come on, \nare you singing with me or what are you doing? Do you want to tell me why…? Do you want to tell us why you are here? Will you tell us…? No? Hello, can you tell me what you are here for?\nWhat demands to you have? Do you want to tell me why you are here?"}

What else do you want? PSD brings order! PSD brings order! Now is the moment to manifest ourselves peacefully. But if it’s necessary, we can manifest\n ourselves in other ways as well.

In three years I’m due to retire, but with nothing \nbecause Iohannis doesn’t want me to work. PSD gives us workplaces. That’s why we’re here to support the\n       PSD, not mister Iohannis. On our way here from Teleorman\n                    everyone… showed us everything. They swore and everything. What for? Because we want to show our justice? Or what we think is right. It doesn’t mean it’s\n      right, but we believe it’s right. Have you ever been the \nvictims of abuse? When I was little, my dad beat me sometimes \nbecause I did silly things… Yes... \"Please excuse us, we \nwon’t talk while you tap us!\" Have you ever been tapped,   \n       tracked or what..? Yes, they listen to us, out phones are tapped. \nThe phones, miss Kovesi. Have you ever suffered  \n    from an abuse? I didn’t     \nbut no more abuses! Have you ever been the victim of abuse? I wasn’t, but others were. That woman that was for three years in jail \nand came back to her children now… Come one leave him; \nhe’s one of them! Did anyone give her anything? Why was Becali in jail? They took him.    \nOne after another, they took Becali too, right? Is it fair This is the mafia! The demonstrators start gathering in Victory Square 4 hours left until the rally begins Tennis lovers could watch the Roland Garros final Simona! This isn’t possible, this isn’t possible... In the 4th set - that’s where it will end. In the 4th-5th set,\n one of the players will have a mental breakdown and I think Simona will be strong. \n     So I believe in her. I see Stephens is strong But I feel she’s losing it. The psychic \n           betrays her.. the American. The public on the Philippe Chatrier arena is\n                               now standing.

Did you see the game until now or did you just arrive? Now! Did you see the game? Yes, yes. Călărași! Are you happy? Yes, yes. Did you see the game? No, because we just arrived. \nWe just arrived. You arrived here safely, right? The protesters continue to arrive in large numbers Pay attention! I want to make everyone \n             aware in this country: Stop protesting for justice! The justice system \ndestroyed Romania, do you understand? They have large pensions, large salaries \n      and they protest for justice... I worked at the foundry on \n  a 50 tons heavy crane. I was testing heavy machinery.   \nWhat are the magistrates doing? I earn 1400 lei (n.r. 300 Euro). \nI’ve been working for 40 years in the first working group Where are the working groups? \nDon't they know anything about them? Don’t take our pension! Up, up! Don’t take our pension, don’t take our salaries, \n     hire young people to work! Make the factories \nlike they used to be! They killed Ceaușescu to be rich!           \n    So they can get money! So they become billionaires! \n    And for us to starve! And you think you will solve \neverything tonight? Well if we solve it, that’s not bad, \n   but I don’t think so... Let’s solve! Let’s solve it    \nbecause we can’t live anymore! I am an old woman, 70 years old,\n and I'm here for my children! Ever since PSD came,     \n we only voted for PSD. I’m an old woman and PSD raised my \n        pensions, help me, he is a good... No… \nThey support the poor. Do you have children? Yes I have children and my children are abroad and we are old and upset           \nbecause there are no jobs and now God will help us and they will give us jobs \n     so that my children will come back. Do you think that maybe your children left\n    the country because of the politicians? Well also because of them, also because…     \nMister Dragnea wants to bring us on the right track. I want mister Dragnea to keep fighting,     \nto get out of the trouble he is in, to not get in jail and to become \nthe president of the country. We support him. My daughter went to university for 6 years. \nI’ve worked with my hands – look, chapped to keep her in college and now she stays home \nand goes to pick strawberries in Germany. And who do you think is to blame for this? That one from the party, \n    the important one. Who? Kovesi, the president… Kovesi is a prosecutor, she doesn’t \n                  have anything to do with jobs. And that Iohannis! Yes! He gave money \n            piles to some and nothing to us. We have children, we have grandchildren. Did they leave or are they in Romania? They left... Do you ever think that the politicians \n                  also caused this? Yes, because of the politicians. Especially right wing, the right wing politicians! Close to Victory Square, at the same time, the diversity march took place This is the first manifestation I am part of;\n it is more positive than the activity of the others. I'm sure there are only sluts there. \n    Here are people that express their love. Good luck! What TV channel is this for? Teleorman! Long live mister president! What do you think about this demonstration? Homosexuals, we want to be homosexuals!\n What do we have to do? What should we do? Why did you come here? For PSD. For an idea, something? Yes, we'll see. Where are you from? From Vaslui. At 20.30 the PSD leaders came out of Victoria Palace and made their way on stage through the crowds Hello, hello!

At least one of them has been tapped.           \n       This is the reality that we live in. Also, even you, probably, \nhave been tapped or are tapped. Behind the scene, the new PSD barons \ndon’t seem to feel the terror of abuse Tired and with a long trip ahead with the bus,                       the people start leaving I was asked why I chose the color            \n                white for today, for our rally It is because white symbolises \n    cleanness, my friends. And this is what we do: we clean the country \nfrom the dirt spread around by these rats! In the end, the PSD leaders tried\n to remake a memorable image however there was no one on the other side to answer They burn our country! There are thieves in Romania. \nWe don’t want to stay and we want justice. That’s why we came here and we will keep coming, until there will be justice in Romania. This is where we live, we work for Romania, \nwe have children and we want everything to be better. Do you all agree? Yes! And leave mister Dragnea to lead the country! Not these bandits! Mister Dragnea should lead the country, leave him alone! Kovesi, the parallel state! He is right, do you know what he does? You are a national embarrassment mister president. That’s not true! A national embarrassment! You should be ashamed! You destroyed a county,                \n                 Teleorman, and now you destroy a country! A leader for thieves and for the mafia! This is what is left behind after you? What? I was asking if this is what is left \n     in our country after you. Someone will clean soon. There are people \n    that came from hundreds of miles away. But shouldn’t they come form\n a good educational system? Cann you let me talk little boy?\n     First I talk, then you talk Eh, that’s at your home. Not in my home, on my money. On my money! You get paid form my money and \nthe money of all the Romanians. If you want to have a dialogue, yes. \nBut the people that come from… But you what dialogue are you having since \nyou’ve been doing whatever you want with this country? Why didn’t you come earlier      \non stage, to tell me? To tell you what?\nTo tell me what you’re saying now.. What can I say? \n             You’re brainwashing people… The ones that voted for PSD are also paying taxes! \n             We also have rights, not only you! We also have rights! We voted! \n            Go out and vote, don’t stay at home."}

They said the fire started somewhere over here And burned, burned it all.You see? Everything burned...all the roof...   Friday, 17 November, 02:30 Recea, Brasov The superior floor of Boeriu family, is completely destroyed in a fire. Viorel and Tina Boeriu escape alive. When I went up there was smoke from one side..   From the knees level, at the top, nothing was visible   I found Tina, I took her hand and I said: ''Take two mouths of fresh air!''   And, on prone, we went down the stairs. Firefighters arrived and..   They broke everything, they watered, all the house was a mess.   I got there, at the time when firefighters were already there,   I saw both of them outside, smoked, Both crying.. At that point, I didn't know what to do. Where to start, that I got there. A few hours later Saturday night we stayed here.   Over our terrace there is a cement slate -  we slept there   Outside was raining.. It was raining, on the stairs the water came like waterfall.. And on Sunday, the roof has been rebuilt.   Dozens of people from Recea and neighborhood towns worked for three days without interruption.       Next day in the morning,  the yard was full of people, On Saturday, planks and rafters have begun to come..   At the time we had the beams, the counter-clock race started.   Someone came, with a truck of wood and rafters. Where did he came from, I do not know. He has suddenly appeared: ''Do you need these?'' He looked at them:''These are good here, those there.'' After that, others came up with physical work: How can we help? Let's carry, Let's carry planks, wood, tiles. Everyone was... At some point you couldn't find a free spot... You did not know what was going on there, who what to do.. One put nails, one gave planks , so it was like an anthill I was so impressed. It's something unthinkable... I couldn't belive: they didn't even let me to help them..     So many people was there.. People who came... It was Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Three days! In three days the house was rebuilt. It was back in place... Even if they didn't know this family, they came up to help.   For example, there were many who didn't know who is Vio or Tina and what happened.. They came because I told them:''Look what happened!'' And they also called others:''Let's go and help with what we can!'' I met really poor people...   I have the lists..5 lei, 10 lei, but it's impressing.   So impressing... People should be better... To help each other... I don't know, we are...we may have another thought... We don't think only about us. We think... We think of the others arround us, we live together with them. We help each other, right? I don't know, the kindness.. Passes from one person to another, I do not know how... If you are kindness with someone, maybe the other see and will do the same.   This is what I think, and... I hope everyone will do the same... After 6 months from fire.. The Boeriu's family house, it's 95% rebuilt.    "}

I bet! He can just take advantage of his position, his political background he's the 3rd man of the State and I'm just... ...a taxi driver I could have let myself being intimidated, but no... no. Not a chance So I'm going to stand a round to the man just like I promised If he would like to talk A little, just as time allows, fine, but if not... ... I won't eat \"mici\" (highly seasoned forcemeat balls), obviously Because I don't really enjoy dole and I'll just leave the crate there and...that's it. ...if he doesn't have enough time. If he does... then we'll talk. I'll try to ask him about the bridge in Galați which we have been waiting to be done since 30 years ago then about the freeways... and much more Only if he has the time...   That one is better, right? Victoriei Square Besider being a taxi driver, I was also a sailor but more like a seafarer And i saw... It was my wife... Hello! I've arrived about half an hour ago. I'm with the boys we're going to buy the beer crate Hi, sweety, I'm listening I'm not there yet, I'll get there at 5  (PM)   I'll make sure to call you first and tell you what I talk with him Ok, honey Ok, I love you, take care! Bye! I can't say for sure that I feel relaxed but also not so... You know, I was more stressed when I married my wife! Upon my word! ...even though I knew my wife for a few years   I can't say I feel at ease Not everyday you're able to drink a beer with Dragnea, right? But I also am not trembling I also saw he's kind of sly   I'm just asking: is there any store? Excuse me, do you have a crate of beer, but I also need the crate [we don't have a crate] I got a few suggestions I thought I should buy a German brand I'm not necessarily going for the quality of the beer but rather for its name, it has to be a German brand Maybe he'll understand something. It's four to... We've got no more time. I'll take them from the fridge and I'll put them in the crate and I'll also pay the crate [just a moment, let me check] Please   Where are you from? \"Iartă-ma\"? (Romaniam TV show, roughly translated as \"Would you forgive me?\") No, from \"Din dragoste\" but with quotation marks I am from there but, I repeat, with quotation marks. Yeah... I'll tell you later anyway So, how much? 20 plus 40, 60 plus, that makes 5 lei... 100... 160 lei   I'm stand a round for Mr. Dragnea, if you didn't know Really? Why? Because I placed a bet with him on Facebook.. I mean it And I lost it, so I promised to give a crate full of beer I bought the crate, thank you very much [you're welcome, thank you] Can I say the place where I bought it? What if tomorrow ANAF comes and runs a check on you? Take care! Where is the station? Over there? or over there? The man with his crate Is he the one with ... the beer? But where are the \"mici\"? Did I promise to bring \"mici\"? Is food all you can think about? Hello, are you the man who won the bet? Yeah, it's me. Hello! Did you bring the beer? What do you think? The full crate? Just as promised! Wait a little bit... please, just stay a while May I just put it down? Thank you very much! Can you tell us the whole story about the bet? Just as you can see... Ursus, man?! The head of the party is supposed to drink this? Come on, man... you should have brought a better one a special one... not this cheap one Do you think I'm special? No! When you come to the head of the party you are not supposed to bring him a cheap bere, dude he will be the future president of Romania Well, I'm not contradicting you... we'll see I'll vote for Băsescu, no offense... But I'm not even mad, vote for whoever you want Just let him in! Just let him in We are pleased to eat \"mici\" and drink beer   Not me!     Done! You have the recording... would you like to have a \"mic\"? Or a beer? But it belongs to him now... Mr. Dragnea, did you bring the \"mici\" from Teleorman? Yes! And how do you see the fact that the one who lost the bet to you does not wish to eat? He won't eat. Maybe he's on a diet. Come on! Haven't you changed your mind about him? Can't he persuade you to change it? It is his duty to try it and mine to not accept it. That's right! That's right! Will you try, mister president, to change the public perception? One meeting is not enough. Please, let me just put... [Will you meet him again?] If we'll bet again, yes! If he'll attend, for sure! Should we bet on freeways before my end of term? I'm not sure if you'll be able to stay until you end of term. Until the end of MY term... Right. How many kilometres will you promise to... I won't promise... ... be freely used? Not started, not designed, but DONE! So I can actually drive my car Sir, I'm telling you, go make a list of complaints, justified or not and send it to me on Facebook, however you'd like, and we'll deal with each and every one of it. If you'd like, we'll bet on each one. To some of them I'll say \"yes\", to some, \"no\". No, right now! Until 2020, should we bet on a crate with beer that you won't make more than...   ...150 km? Ready to be used! Which I can drive my car freely! On a crate with beer I think it will be done I don't know. I bet until 2020... Take it easy... It was already enough that Iohannis scolded me... No, I didn't come to argue with you... I'm just saying we'll do more! On a crate of beer!                 Pretty much of what he said on TV, he also told me. If after watching TV I felt fooled, now I felt the same way. Fooled, meaning he told me the same things. When? How much? \"Be patient!\" For how long? He sure knows how to speak and if you loose it he'll mess you up. Well, I'm different! I asked him about the freeways, I said: \"in 28 years you have done 100 kilometres\" I think if I were to make it, I would have done more with 5 other friends... He said \"Europe doesn't let us, some sort of NGO found some bats somewhere in a hollow\" I said \"Ok, but the bridge in Galați...\" ...cause I live there The bridge in Galați, there's been 28 years... He said it's still in the design stage, come on, for 28 years? He started to talk about the bridge but ended by bringing up SRI (Romanian Intelligence Service ) and some protocols but I said \"Stop, I'm way too little for these things\" SRI... DNA. lalala, lalala \"I know that if I have to go\" to Constanța, at the sea, I have to use the ferry from time to time   for 28 years... it's not ok He said I'm right I was like \"Thank you, but what can you do? 'cause I'm tired of this\"   This is the reality. You don't believe me? Come with me! Let's go now! I'll pay for the bus and we'll go, drink a beer and tomorrow morning we'll check the street... to see how it is I told him I'll leave the country, he said he hopes I'll change my mind, but I won't! I'll leave the country and I'm taking my family with me I'm not leaving today and return tomorrow, I'll take my family and leave! He said \"I'm sorry!\" I am sorry...

How long are you going to be there for? And what are you doing after 12? You're not going to the disco, are you? Ok, bye! Grandma, do you think the priest will allow me to go live from church? My grandma is saying \"It's only one leu for a candle here\" Hi Dorel! Look at the girl in the skirt! She's really hot!

Kisses to all my brothers, we wish you a happy Easter next to this jacuzzi pool.

I didn't even go to work for two weeks, I was so angry... You see? How could I go in to talk to her, hit on her...tell her my love, you're beautiful... I didn't, it wouldn't look good It would have been better if I found out sooner, you know, rather than later, so I don't have to be all stressed out That could be the problem, yes... Whoever it was, a friend or anyone, it would have made me feel better. Because I knew I could get out earlier, you know, I would have known, wait, maybe she wants someone else, you know?

The poor \"is\" many. They each did their own job, but when it came to us: \"leave them, they won't die\" Lots of water! And look, it got up to here, the centre. Does anyone do anything? These guys from Bucharest do anything? They're all from Teleorman. Please don't ask me what kind of power they hold... I'm just a fool compared to them. Our county is the leadership of the country. Down here, from our (lands). Nobody is a match for God. Not even Videle, nor Teleorman. During Ceausescu's reign, I was a tractor driver I have 46 years of experience, of \"tractorship\" They made canals, Ceausescu made canals on the whole plain You wouldn't see water on the plain. No. The water would drain slowly down the valley It would go to where it belonged But now, the canals have been plugged because the people did not have enough arable land The county's council belongs to Dragnea - the \"Father\", \"Daddy\" And the guys who won the elections by... (bribes) are from PNL And they don't care for them now - \"Deal with it!\" they said. 20 village households have been significantly damaged by the waters This always comes - it always fills up like now as soon as it rains or the snow melts, it always comes. Michael! Hey! Tell the girl to come over! Come in! The chickens have drowned The pigs - we were in luck that we could take them to our neighbour We got used to it. The last time we had it worse. We had to wear our boots inside the house. It's the second time that (the flood) comes (The flood) came the first time on the 8th. on \"women's day\", Thursday. And today is the 14th. The water made me fall so much. I don't even remember how many times. Just look... This is a doggy :-) And the crone is inside the home The waters are here, Joanna. God, what do we do? It's getting in. If it climbs any more... it will be inside the bedroom. Yes, it will... You can't do anything. Without a dam, the people of Draganesti Vlasca wait for the waters to withdraw by themselves, like with any flood.

Yes, we're going this way, he's coming from the other direction. He's coming here, at the PECO (abbrv. Etylated Products with Octane Cipher from communist times) We're going on foot? Go, go!

Articolul complet e aici: http://bit.ly/2iZXyKp", "transcript": "65% of companies operating in Romania are unable to find skilled workers for employment. Vocational schools should produce the craftsmen that the economy needs. For the past few years, Romania has neglected vocational education, and this is obvious now more than ever. This is how a assembly line looks like in a typical factory in the 21st century. And this is how a locksmiths workshop looks like in a vocational school in Romania. The mechanical workshop at Rușețu Technological High School (Buzău County) They have to make an overlay assembly of two flat strips, head to head, with a splint. What do you use this for? What do you use it for? So you can assemble two flat strips. A 30 years old drilling machine breaks during the practical lessons. A mechanic comes to fix it. Screw it tightly! Despite all efforts, the machine refuses to drill any longer. Yes, all you can see here is from before the Revolution. Even the grinding machine is... because I remember working for the company... the grinding machine is from those times, the drilling machine, from those times the strung is just a mockup, it doesn't actually work... 30 years ago Another mechanic comes to fix the drilling machine. The machine is still not working. It's the mandrel, it's not that it doesn't work... the problem is one of the accessories... Beat the flat strip! There you go! Beat it so that it...so...so Finally, the students are assigned other activities. We want to give them a chance to easily integrate into the local, but also national and even European labour markets This is how weaving looks like in the developed side of Europe. And this is how weaving is learnt in a vocational school in Romania. In most of these schools, there have been no investments in the past years. Everything is miles away from the current labour market demands. How do you call that instrument that you use for pushing? Normally, it would be a reed but this is an improvisation... It's supposed to be the complete one... with the reed you push and pull the weave But this is only half of it, so we can work with it... because it's not the complete loom, of course... So then you are practically simulating now... We're simulating, we simulate the weaving process 60 years ago This is the warp. As we don't have a loom, we can't get the warp onto that warp beam that you probably saw at home. so we fixed it with these clips, ok? This is the yarn which is usually held on a shuttle a shuttle which should have a bobbin here somewhere, ok? It was an instrument that you used to take in an out and so on... it is an instrument that...we don't have, that's it...I know it's... An improvisation... It's an improvisation, yes... In Romanian schools, students work as they did 100 years ago with improvised materials, brought from home, from the teacher's personal trousseaus. Where do you have that from? From my grandmother who passed away in 2000. We don't have anything covered. Firstly, sewing machines. Festooning machines, ironing machine I saw that we don't even have the ironing board anymore We need...we have absolutely nothing. What job would you like to have, Maria? Well, I would really like to continue doing this, tailoring, but... unfortunately...if this is all we learn... And we don't have sewing machines...and so many other things... Did you ever get to use a sewing machine? No. It is very difficult for a child that leaves here with nothing to get a job. Where could they find one? The practical lessons that vocational schools offer are not enough to shape a skilled worker. But it's absurd, you can't do anything, it's impossible. It is impossible for a child to be a skilled worker after has only done one or two practical hours per week... I find it to be a bit...delusional what we do here. They're not skilled workers... the kids don't learn a skill anymore, we don't have any equipment anymore... This is how work in the electronics industry is done nowadays. What are you doing there? Could you explain because I don't... I'm trying to glue this. And? Well, nothing is happening... Do you want to try again? The metal should melt and stick to... And, is anything happening at the moment? No. There should be a substance inside, and I think there's nothing left... to glue. Future electricians are 20 years behind technology. Basic notions. To be able to properly hold a screwdriver, to make a measurement, to be able to glue a transistor or two. Students have put together a transistor that gives power to a small radio 50 years ago... What do you usually do during a practical lesson? Is this how it looks like? No... But? He usually gives us more of a lecture. We haven't done any practical work yet Only theory. Practical lessons are thus, long and boring. And students are more and more confused about their future What are you going to do after you graduate? What is going to be written on your diploma? Electrician. Electrician What do you know how to do, as an electrician? Plugs, something? No. But, on the computer? A little bit."}

Mai multe, aici: http://bit.ly/2xXk1A2", "transcript": "Roșia Montană\nSeptember 29th 2017 A German expert came to evaluate if the archaeological sites deserve to be part of the UNESCO World Heritage His report is vital for the future of Roșia Montană A lot of money are involved It's all about a mountain of gold and above all, a mining company that still                                        \nwants to exploit the area. The Romanian state always had a contradictory               \n      approach regarding the Roșia Montană case. All of this led to a situation where an UNESCO expert is held at the gates, while officials hope that he'll               understand their position and willingly leave. Good morning! We want to enter in the museum. The museum is closed until.      \n            next week. It's been closed for some time... Why? Order from Roșiamin Deva... You recived an order to close the museum? And what would be the reason for doing this? I don't know. I'm just telling you... Do you know that we have an official paper... I know, I'm just telling you... This man wants to say that      \n                    he's the ICOMOS delegate. and we want to enter the museum,            \n            as we previously communicated. You didn't communicate with me, \n       I'm just the guardsman. I mean with you, as Roșiamin... And I am telling you that the museum is closed... Is the director of the museum here? At the moment, no, he's not present. Nobody's here? Only you, as the guardsman? They're coming later... At what time? Helmuth Albrecht, \nPhD in archeology, UNESCO expert Repeatedly, the UNESCO expert was stopped                \nfrom seeing the archaeological sites                               \neligible for World Heritage Beatrice Cauuet, expert in Roșia Montană's galleries, was also part of the expedition, along with Barry Gamble, external adviser of the National Institute of Heritage Irina Iamandescu (Director of the Immobile Heritage Department of NIH) This whole situation is ridiculous! The closing of the site \n                                     was presented as a safety measure I want you to know that we have protection equipment,          \n      therefore, we can enter the places we asked to see, places which are historical monuments, and that we           want to show to the assessor. It is proposed for the UESCO expert that have a touristic visit. Ok, ok, we've already seen the touristic route. Thanks! The Gold Corporation employees are filming every move of the UNESCO expert. Finally, in order to avoid other embarrassing moments, the Roșiamin officials decide to open the gates. I want to say hello to you, I'm the mission expert. Nice to meet you I'm honored, I'am very honored. At least... at least... finally... I've been here in May I have seen you in May... Ok, so... I'am glad that you are here... Valentin Rus (director of Roșiamin): This is Romania, yes? This is our world, our very interesting world today... Welcome back, hello! I'm sorry and I'm honnored that you reached Roșia Montană, but... I'm not by myself here. If the museum was mine, there would have been a different situation. The guests are invited inside. This is another entrance and, actually, it connects with the roman mining level. What you visited with the tourists, you can come outside with the tourists on another route, second route Could we go? Can we see that? Yeah, but we need to put the boots on, no? Oh, no  today we will not entrance to here. We go only in the touristic parts. We could see the entrance? Can we? Yeah, but it's blocked. Only \n      the entrance, I can show you only the entrance here... We cannot visit with \n       you today this entrance, you know very clear... It's a decline... A final decline. This is the old entrance... so... The experts are held at the entrance. You can not see the ruins there. There are old, old-old It was used like a deposit for black powder, is from the end of the 18th century there. Yes but we cannot see.     There's only ruins Oh, it's locked... Yeah, it's locked. It's only for miners, only for specialists... Can't go there with tourists \nit's forbidden for tourist... only with specialists with,                   \nwith special equipment like you know, with boots, with overalls, with helmets But we have that in the car. Yes, but today you cannot visit here. In this moment I can visit with you only the museum. We are not tourists, we're experts. You know this... No, today you are tourists. No, I do not know. Today... yeah... We are not autorised to... Yeah, only the touristic part I can visit with you today. I hope you understand Only the touristic part, because I know that you know better than me the underground network But today do not force the problem... So\nit's an interesting situation. We do not want to bring you into trouble. Ok, thank you. We visit only the touristic part, ok? Thank you. The UNESCO expert enjoyed a touristic tour. He admired the mining machinery used as a set-up for the Romanian movies in the 70's If you are ready, I'll be going in front of you... Again, it's a dangerous place. You are on your own there and perhaps we will feel a little emotion because of the gold The gold has a fairy, it is protective and\nsometimes the gold go madness If you see de gold, of course... We experienced this madness during this days. Again, I will say it in romanian... Please close the door behind you. There’s little piece \n               of wire... have to close from inside. Ok. The door! Please close the door! The story of sending the Roșia Montană's file to UNESCO has materialized during the government led by Dacian Cioloș, in 2016 and the beginning of 2017. Corina Suteu, the former minister of Culture, send the file in her last day at office. The government changed in January 2017 and this also changed the intentions of Romania regarding Roșia Montană. Last month, the prime minister Mihai Tudose declared his intentions to withdraw the file from UNESCO Ultimately, the file wasn't withdrawn, but the intention was to obstruct the evaluation so that the report will be      negative It's like a game, it's a little bit \n       like a game: they first are trying to hold us back and then Irina was doing a lot of                  \n       work and phoning and so, and then they let us in. So yesterday we could visit some sites outside we weren't allowed two days ago to go there, But they allowed it now and we hope that I can get into the roman mines at twelve o'clock So, it's going to be an intresting report.... Cătălina-Monulești Galleries An employee of Roșia Montană       \n       Gold Corporation is filming the delegation. In case of a positive answer from UNESCO, the terms of exploitation will became very rigid. RMGC is still the owner of the exploitation licence in Roșia Montană. The delegation is held at the gates of the gallery for half an hour whitout any explanation. The UNESCO expert asks for a picture with the slogan of RMGC: \"We want to work, not to beg!\" Which is a good slogan for our World Heritage project And for the mission too! We want to work, not to beg. Finally, the delegation is allowed to enter the courtyard of the gallery A miner from RMGC holds a GoPro on his helmet,   instead of o lamp. Irina Iamandescu: We visited most of sites we wanted to... finnaly we manage to do it... It was a little bit difficult at the beginning, because we didn't have access, but we're happy that, finally, things got well Citizen of Roșia Montană: We're sorry that those who are here, with mean interests At the end of the expedition, the locals said good-bye to the guests. and want to destroy what's here disturbed them and didn't let them see what's here. We saw! You saw finally, you saw but not everything! It's a pitty that in this moment Romania is led by some incompetents. Romania is ruled by some failures. Oh, how to translate this... UNESCO will give an official answer  regarding Roșia Montană at the mid of next year. Entrance is strictly forbidden. Those who will not comply will be punished!"}

That is one of the layers of the brain If you don't close it well, you have a risk of a fistula that means that  the liquid that washes the brain leaks out it comes out of the wound. He has a risk of dying   this means that out of 500 patients, how many we have presently, statisticly per year let's say 1% dies because we didn't close it well. A thread that costs them 10 lei 15 lei maybe. So 1 % That means that at the end of each year The two of us have at least 2-3 patients on our conscience because we made this compromise how do you feel? how would you feel? how? ... please tell me how? X and Y have died because we closed incompletly the wound Because we didn't have a 15 lei thread It's... It's ... how would you feel AH We saved 400... So what? Not those 400 are on my mind Those 2 are on my mind I know all my patient who've suffered in this hospital. Who had complications who died. I know them all And I can say that in this moment and you can look at the familiy because for this patient I am sure I did all that was possible But I can't and then the family is okay with you. (family) \"He has done all that he can\" He didn't make any compromise but if one these died because I made a compromise How would you feel then? Does this medcine have any purpose? Has neurosurgery any purpose? Is there any purpose in doing this? What do I do now? It doesn't have any purpose. What does it matter that if you save 1000 but killed 1? It's like you killed him, you didn't cut his carotid Simply, you have killed him by making the decision to operate him in a place in which there are no proper conditions And the conditions that are must cost 10 lei! 15 lei 15 lei, 6 lei or the salary of a nurse Are we really this poor? Sincerely, Thousands leave, we lament over it, but we can't hire a nurse Ok, we can't I understand I think we are in a very grave situation we as a country So I can't take part in a crime The two doctors have done their residency in France and in 2014 they came back to practice in Romania After 3 years at the Colentina Hospital, they are leaving the neurosurgery department which they built from zero Everything in this department, every power socket every bed, every object ... from the neurosurgery department and from the surgical block were drawn initially by Dr. Bica and I Then, we were site managers, we were architects we were a lot of other jobs and in 8 months it was done the whole neurosurgery department and the whole surgical block. The old administration helped us hire the medical personnel every time the opportunity presented itself The new managment has done everything to kick everyone present out In January 2017, Gabriela Firea, the mayor of the capital, has changed the managment of the Colentina hospital, naming Silvi Ifrim in the function of provisory manager With the change of the manager   regarding the neurosurgery department It seemed it wasn't a priority anymore. There are even a harrassment, I can say with no doubt of the medical personnel, of us of our fellow colleagues. What does this harassment consist of? There are daily checks in the recovery units in the ICU and neurosurgery departments they count the patients they check the attendence Now in January 2017 We were reffered for a surgery two patients the patients with extremely difficult pathology for which we needed on average over 12 hours of surgery                                                                                                                                     I even asked them Assume this   (hospital) No no   Circus (n.b. about the situation) We are neurosurgeons not circus actors What should I do? Come, operate , do not operate? Did you sign, did you respect your contract? No. Ok Doctors Ionut Gobej and Dorin Bica haven't decided yet wheter they will still work in Romania or return to France Surely. I can tell you That in five years I'll still be a neurosurgeron There are all kinds of options now I am too tired and too angry to answer this question Of course. I've told you We can talk about Pitié-Salpêtrière (n.b. Hospital) from Paris which is an extraordinary thing you operate in the time in which you can the nurses who are always smiling, in a system that works perfectly It is an option But only in Paris   Then Let's take it logically, other options If not outside, then there's also Romania If not Bucharest, there are other cities Still I'll be a neurosurgeon and next week, only it will be a holiday if we'll do something in Romania I'm convinced we'll take more care with the conditions we'll ask with the evolution of things, so that a change in managment or the chaning of a man won't affect our activity                                                                                  "}

I have been a priest in the Romanian Orthodox Church... serving in a number of parishes from Buzău and Vrancea. When i got myself ordained I was barely a child After the first held confessions I've grown up ...after the first interments I became callous! I had a serene job. I was respected. But I was living a grave conflict And one day I decided to stop! I can't prove to anyone that... there's nothing above us!...a God! But for me, at any time, I can prove to myself that the one I was set to serve does not exist. And after so many years in which.. I've been a central part of this religious system ...and I've fostered it... I've reached a simple conclusion... The first sermon of an atheist priest When I first started on this path of theology over two decades ago I was really devout I didn't know what comprises my religion, except some vague aspects but I was faithful. That's how I was raised up to be. But soon, after starting to understand what those beliefs were I narrowed down much of my certainties Even from my second year of theological seminar it already didn't seem reasonable to accept that people die because someone bit from an apple, some thousands years ago ...or other things as such. I believe that then, in my 2nd high-school year, there was my first contact with disbelief But as time passed, I've kept a certainty with which I actually entered priesthood and that was: Christ maybe the others from the Old Gospel are conflicting or childish or arrived there from older religions but it is impossible that Christ wouldn't have meant anything. Now I realised that I already was in a conflict, back then That religion is a \"Whole\" if one single piece from this Whole falls the Whole falls in its entirety it can't be revealed or godly. If one can't believe that Noah had found all the animal species and climbed them up in a boat, one can stop...the rest is already irrelevant! However I've attached myself somehow to (the truth of) Christ by squeezing my eyes, not to see the whole and that's how I entered priesthood. I can still remember that at the start of the seminar\nmy hands almost shivered as I was opening the Bible. How did I end up at a resignation after all this decade and at \"The confession of a faithless priest\" I kept asking myself and I believe there were several factors from which, maybe, two that weighted decisively towards it. Firstly, I'm certain that it had to do a lot with my concurrent study of ancient greek that I actually taught afterwards for years at the same seminar where I've also graduated. And precisely this study on the ancient writings made me look at the Bible with different eyes, other than the perspective that was thought to me. in the theological schools. And that's how I arrived to a fundamental conclusion for my current understanding. And this is: ancient literature preserves between the lines the evolution of the human mind(reasoning). And the Bible does the same thing by being a collection of writings created at\nvery different intervals of time. From the start to its end, the same topics or realities end up obviously contradicting themselves. Because the human mind changes. What do I actually want to say? The biblical lectures\ndoesn't have (a type of) coherence. from one end to the other. Even so, sometimes it's much too far from even being humane, in the plenary and beautiful sense of the word; much more so from being godly! These are things that anyone can check. ...it's enough to open a Bible. They should, however, read with their own eyes and not with a prior, imposed conception. However, the decisive factor I believe it had to do more with a moment in (my) life. I've already been a priest for many years and I was in America with some study work. In a giant library from New York I was specifically searching for early Christianity literature. I only then found out after so many years of Orthodox Theology, that Christ hadn't even established the holy mass. meaning the ritual of communion or of \"breaking the bread\". it was simply a common practice in that time's Judaism that Jesus was conducting like other jews. I'd been a priest for so many years and had studied much more Orthodox Theology, but had no idea! I had studied only what was taught to me in the theological schools and went only through Orthodox bibliography. That was the final straw. How could I get in front of all the people at the sermon and tell them that Christ had established the holy communion, the breaking of bread when in fact it is untrue. How could I tell to grieving parents that their child died from the bite from an apple, thousands of years ago? And how can I do that to myself, for the rest of my life? Maybe some will blame me that I've conceded to share you thoughts like these. But the blame doesn't lie on me that Jesus didn't actually establish the breaking of the bread. The fact that I utter these things(words) - that can be checked by anyone - does it mean I do wrong? Wouldn't I have failed more, were I to have remained a priest and to rave from the pulpit things in which I could no longer hold faith in? What is the hardest thing to me now that I've renounced priesthood, is the separation from people... which respected me much more than I deserved. And that I, myself, have held in high regard, much more than I've ever shown to them. And people that I got connected to even beyond priesthood. There were some amongst them - intellectuals - to whom I've been speaking afterwards and who have told me they would have even accepted me like this even as an unbeliever only that I'd stay to be their priest. What do we place instead of religions, however? How could we know in what manner a world without God could deviate? Without the consciousness of a overwhelming authority that would compel it(the world) to do good? But here we already have the answer given by the 21th century world the one from the west. People that have reached the civilization level of that place even though they don't connect to any religion, and the churches are sold and rented, are still living beautifully and they get involved in so many forms of volunteering. Of course this is just a simplistic generalization and not every single one of them lives like that. But these westerners - even if we call them agnostics, homosexuals or atheists or whatever - give us a formidable lesson this days: they do good selflessly! They get involved in humanitarian causes without expecting any reward from above. While our, so called, \"Christians\" do not, or very few of them do. And by this they contradict the very humanism that they appropriate. I cannot prove to anyone that there's nothing above us!...a God! But for me, at any time, I can prove to myself that this one,that I was set to serve, does not exist. And after so many years in which I've been a central part of this religious system ...and I've fostered it... I've reached a simple conclusion. I don't know and I wouldn't want another cult or some other venture that would drive human kind, other than this - which is actually the creed from \"The confession of a faithless priest\" - that is: a bet with oneself the he'd be able to self-improve forever in intelligence in the understanding of his own world, in life expectancy and so on but not through mithology but through science and technology that is through deciphering this world. The answers to our illnesses and infirmities are here in us and in the world surrounding us. It's here that both the Cancer and Ebola happen! It's us that are looking for answers and solutions in other worlds. \"Help me Brahma!\" or \"Allah, save my child!\" when the solutions are here. And why? Because we belong to this world. You know, maybe when... you'll completely understand what I'm telling you now? Only when life will place you in face of great helplessness. Only when you'll run as mad with your ill child in your arms and he'd stick feeble small fingers in your arms, wanting to live, what if you will be powerless then? Only in that immense powerlessness of yours one which, as a priest, I've come to know in so many destinies. Only then, maybe, you'll give me merit for the reasons I've arrived at my gesture of honesty that of renouncing priesthood and a way a life that would have been so effortless for me. An why I've arrived at my current understanding. Only then, maybe, you'd have whished hospitals and research institutes, instead of the hundreds of monasteries built, founded, re-whitened in the last years only due to the bare ambition of some bishops that competed between themselves in (numbers of) foundations. monasteries that today lie empty because no one enters them. If in the future The Church won't truly take responsability its social scale no matter how much reinforced concrete would feed itself, it will collapse! At that point when you, leadership of such a great institution - because this wasn't the decision of common priests - take responsibility for such a costly and grandiose project knowing that, in this world, millions of people perish in poverty and even in our country there are children that huddle at night in their beds because they don't have anything to eat, when you take responsibility for such an action you find yourself gravely adrift! I took responsibility for a simple gesture of honesty towards myself. I only ask: If tomorrow all the people that know deep inside that they serve false interests which put them in conflict with themselves, if they'd make the same honesty gesture themselves until tomorrow evening, this world would irreversibly change. Of course it wouldn't be \"this\" World. But I wouldn't have forgiven myself if I wouldn't have done this gesture. I've seen too many destinies scattering into too much lack of common sense! And too much human defeat (for me) to have accepted such a convenience of my own waste and so much lack of awareness in my destiny. But what if we'd free our consciences how far would we be able to go? This thought intrigues me beyond measure! What if we'd sit alone face to face with our own limitations how far would we be able to go?"}
